What is a register??::
Registers are places where you can read and write some text. +
Think of them as Vim's clipboard.

How will you display the contents of a register?::
`:registers` or `:reg`

Which keystroke specifies the register `<reg>` to be read or written?::
`"<reg>`

How will you write to a register?::
To write to a register:
* Hit `"a` in NORMAL mode to specify what register you want to write on.
* Yank, change or delete some content to write it to register `a`.
** for example, by using `dd` in normal mode.

How will you read from a register `a`?::
* Hit `"a` in NORMAL mode to specify what register you want to read.
* Use a put keystroke in NORMAL mode to spit out the content of the register in your current buffer.
** An example of a put keystroke is a `P` or `p` command.

How many types of registers are there in Vim?::
There are 10 different types of registers.

What does the unnamed register contain?::
It contains the last deleted, changed, or yanked content even if one register is specified.

How will you paste content present in the unnamed register?::
`""p`

What does the `0` numbered register contain?::
The content of the last yank.

How will you paste content present in the last yank using a register?::
`"0`

What do the numbered registers `1` to `9` contain?::
They contain the content you have deleted or changed.
+
. Each time you delete or change content, it will be added to register `1`.
. The previous content of the register `1` will be assigned to register `2`, the previous content of `2` to `3`...
. When something is added to the register `1`, the content of the register `9` is lost.
+
None of these registers are written if you've specified one before with the keystroke `"`.

What is the small delete register?::
The `-` register. +
It contains any deleted or changed content smaller than one line. +
It is not written if you specified a register with `"`.

What are named registers?::
They range from `a` to `z`. +
Vim will never write to them if you do not specify the keystroke `"`. +
You can use the uppercase name of each register to append to it (instead of over-writing it).

What are read only registers?::
They are `".`, `"%` and `":`. +

* `.` contains the last inserted text.
* `%` contains the name of the current file.
* `:` contains the most recent command line executed. 

What is an alternate buffer register?::
It is `#`. +
It contains the alternate buffer for the current window.

What is an expression register?::
It is `"=`.
It stores the result of an expression.

What are the selection registers?::
They are `"+` and `"*`.

* `+` is synchronized with the system clipboard.
* `*` is synchronized with the selection clipboard (only on *nix systems).

What is a black hole register?::
It is the `"_` register. +
Everything written in there will disappear forever.

What is the last search pattern register?::
This register contains your last search. +
It is the `"/` register.

What gets output when the put command is used without specifying the register?::
It will output the unnamed register by default.

What happens when you add the line `clipboard+=unnamedplus` to your vimrc?::
In this case, the content you change, delete, or yank will go directly in the unnamed register and the `+` register. 
+
Using the put commands will directly output the `+` register too.
+
Many find it useful to access the OS clipboard more easily, without the need to specify the `+` register for reading and writing it.

How can you append to your macro recording?::
. Hit `qa` and record whatever keystrokes you want.
. Stop the recording by hitting `q` again.
. You realize that you forgot a couple of keystrokes.
. Execute your keystrokes to be sure you are at the last position of your recording.
. Hit `qA` to _append_ to your register `a`.
. When you are done, hit `q` again.

How can you paste or use the content of a register in INSERT mode or COMMAND LINE mode?::
`Ctrl+R<reg>` to put the content of `<reg>` in your current buffer.

What is an expression register?::
It can evaluate custom functions that you have defined while staying in insert mode.

Give an example of how you can use an expression register?::
. Switch to INSERT mode and hit keystroke `Ctrl+r =`.
. You will move to the Vim's command line.
. Type any vimscript expression you want, like `system("ls")` or `4+4`.
. Hit `Enter` to run the expression.
. The output of the shell command `ls` is directly inserted in the buffer.

How can you clear a register?::
`qaq` +
Beginning a recording also deletes everything which is in this register. +
So you need to just stop the recording by hitting q again to have an empty register.


What is a substitution?::
A substitution is a way to replace some content with some other content, using a range and a count. +
The count will decide how many lines is affected by your substitution from the last line of your range.

What is the default range of a substitution command?::
The default range is the current line if you do not specify it.

What is the pattern of the substitution command?::
`:s/pattern/replacement/flags`

* *pattern* is the search you want to match.
* *replacement* will replace the first match of the pattern on each line.
* *flag* modify the behaviour of the command.

Is the *replacement* mandatory in a substitution command?::
No, if you omit it, the substitute command will delete the pattern matched.
