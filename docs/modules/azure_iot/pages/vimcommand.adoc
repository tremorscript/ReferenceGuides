* It can have three different states.
** active - The buffer is displayed in the window.
** hidden - The buffer is not displayed, but it exists and the file is still open.
** inactive - The buffer is not displayed and empty. It is not linked to any file.

[]
 * `:buffers` displays the buffer list. Each line contains:
 ** The buffer id.
 ** Indicators - `a` for active. `h` for hidden. `(space)` for inactive.
 ** The name of the buffer. It can be the filepath of the file linked to the buffer.
 ** The line number where the cursor is.

[]
* `:help buffers` - displays the help file for buffers
* `:help :buffers` - displays the help file for buffers.


== Windows

.Concept
* A window is a space you can use to display the contents of a buffer.
* When you close the window, the buffer stays open.
* When you open vim, one window with one empty buffer is automatically created.

.Commands
* `Ctrl+W s` - Split the current window horizontally.
* `Ctrl+Alt+W v` - Split the current window vertically.
* `Ctrl+W n` - Split the current window horizontally and edit a new file.
* `Ctrl+W ^` - Split the current window with the alternate file.
** The alternate file is the file with the `#` indicator in the buffer list.
* `<buffer_id>Ctrl+W ^` Split window with buffer of id `<ID>`. 
** For example, `75 Ctrl+W ^` will open a window with the buffer of ID 75.

[]
* `Ctrl+W j` - moves the cursor to the bottom window.
* `Ctrl+W k` - moves the cursor to the top window.
* `Ctrl+W h` - moves the cursor to the left window.
* `Ctrl+W l` - moves the cursor to the right window.

[]
* `Ctrl+W r` - Rotate the windows.
* `Ctrl+W x` - Exchange with the next window.

[]
* `Ctrl+W =` - Resize windows for them to fit on the screen with the same size.
* `Ctrl+W -` - Decrease windows's height.
* `Ctrl+W +` - Increase windows's height.
* `Ctrl+W <` - Decrease windows's width.
* `Ctrl+W >` - Increase window's width.

[]
* `:q` - to quit the current window.
* `:q!` - to quit the current window with an unsaved buffer.

[]
* `:help windows` - opens the help file for windows.
* `:help opening-window` - opens the help file for opening windows.
* `:help window-move-cursor` - opens the help file for moving the cursor between windows.
* `:help window-moving` - opens the help file for moving the windows.
* `:help window-resize` - opens the help file for resizing windows.

== Tabs

* Tabs is a container for a bunch of windows.
* It's very different from the concept of tabs in a standard IDE.

[]
* `:tabnew` or `:tabe` - Opens a new tab.
* `:tabclose` or `:tabc` - Close the current tab.
* `:tabonly` or `:tabo` - Close every other tab except the current one.
* `gt` - go to the next tab.
* `gT` - go to the previous tab.
** `1gT` - go to the first tab.
* `:help tab-page` - opens the help file for tab page.

== Argument List

* The argument list is the fourth and last container allowing you to organize your open files.
* It is a stable subset of the buffer list.
* It follows these two rules:
** Every file in the arglist will be in the buffer list.
** Some buffers in the buffer list won't be in the arg list.
* The arglist can be useful to isolate some files from the buffer list to do some operations on them.

[]
* `:args` - Display the arglist.
* `:argsadd` - Add file to the arglist.
* `:argdo` - Execute a command on every file in the arglist.
* `:next` - Move to the next file in the arglist for editing.
* `:prev` - Move to the previous file in the arglist for editing.
* `:first` - Move to the first file in the arglists.
* `:help arglist` - opens the help file for arglists.

== Mapping Keystrokes

* `:nmap` - Create a new mapping for NORMAL mode.
* `:imap` - Create a new mapping for INSERT mode.
* `:xmap` - Create a new mapping for VISUAL mode.
* `:cmap` - Create a new mapping for COMMAND-LINE mode.

[]
* `:nmap w dd` - This will map `dd` which deletes a line in normal mode to `w`.
* `:nmap v w` - Now `v` will also delete line. `v` maps to `w` which maps to `dd`. This is called a recursive mapping.

It would be nice to:
* Map `w` to `dd`
* Map `v` to the motion made by `w` before its mapping with `dd`.

* `:nnoremap` - Create mapping for NORMAL mode (non recursive).
* `:inoremap` - Create mapping for INSERT mode (non recursive).
* `:vnoremap` - Create mapping for VISUAL mode (non recursive).
* `:cnoremap` - Create mapping for COMMAND-LINE mode (non recursive).

* `:nnoremap w dd`
* `:nnoremap v w`
* This time, `w` deletes a line and `v` moves from word to word.

You can use special characters in your mapping
* `<space>` for Space.
* `c-w` for Ctrl+W.
* `<cr>` for carriage return (Enter).
* `<esc>` for escape.
* `:help key-notation` - opens the help file that gives more information of the keys.

[]
* As a best practice, do not change the default key mappings.
* To create new mappings, use a special key called the _leader_ key.
* It is a way to create mapping namespaces.
* First, you use your leader key, then you use your keystroke.
* Thanks to the leader key, the new keystroke will never conflict with the default Vim keystrokes.

* `:let mapleader = "<space"` - set the variable mapleader to your leader key.
* `:nnoremap <leader>bn :bn<cr>` - `<space> bn` will move to the next buffer.
* `:nnoremap <leader>tn gt` - `<space> tn` will move to the next tab.

When you want to map a keystroke to a command, you need to add `<cr>` at the end exactly like you would type `ENTER`.

* `:help mapping` - opens the help file for more information on mapping.
* `:help leader` - opens the help file for more information on leader.

== Jump Motion

=== Jump List

Each time we use a jump motion, the position of the cursor before the jump is saved in the _jump list_.

* `Ctrl+o` - Go to the previous cursor position.
* `Ctrl+i` - Go to the next cursor position.
* `:jumps` - Displays your jump list.

=== Change List

Each time you insert something the position of your cursor is saved in the change list.

* `g;` - Jump to the next change.
* `g,` - Jump to the previous change.

=== Methods Jumping

* `[m` - move to start of a method.
* `]m` - move to the end of a method.

[]
* `:help jump-motions`
* `:help jump-list`
* `:help changelist`

== Repeating Keystrokes

=== Single Repeat

* `.` - Repeat the last change.
* `@:` - Repeat the last command executed.
* `:help single-repeat`

=== Macro

. `q<lowercase_letter>` - Begin recording keystrokes in a register.
. Every keystroke you do onwards will be saved.
. `q` - Stop the recording.
. `@<lowercase_letter>` - Execute the keystrokes you have recorded.

Example:

. Hit `qa`.
. Do what you have to do. For example: `^cawhello<esc>`
. Hit `q` again.
. To execute your series of keystrokes, hit `@a`. For the example above, go on a new line. 

* `@@` - repeats your previous `@` command.

== Command Line Window

* `q:` - Open command line history
* `q/` and `q?` - Open search history
* `Ctrl+f` - Open command line history while in COMMAND LINE mode.
* `:history` - Also opens command line history
* `:help cmdline-window` - opens the help for the command line window.
* `:help 'history'` - opens the help for the history command.


== Undo Tree

Vim allows you to save all undos in a file, for each file you modify.

It means that even after closing vim, you will have access to your last change by "undoing" them.

You need to configure it in you vimrc file, by adding the following:

[source]
----
"save undo trees in files
set undofile
set undodir=~/.vim/undo

"number of undo saved
set undolevels=10000
----

The option `undolevels=10000` saves a maximum of 10,000 undos per file.

Vim not only saves a list of undos, it saves a whole undo tree.


* `:help undo-redo`
* `:help undo-persistence`
* `:help undo-tree`


== Useful "g" keystrokes

* `gf` - Edit the file located at the filepath under your cursor.

** It will use the default application used by your OS for this filetype.
** It will also open the file in your favourite browser and load the website, if you have the `netrw` plugin.
* `gi` - Move to the last insertion you did and switch to INSERT mode.
** Pretty useful if you stopped editing to look at some other file.
* `gv` - Start VISUAL mode and use the selection made during the last VISUAL mode.
* `gn` - Select the match of your last search:
** Move to the last searched match.
** Switch to VISUAL mode.

* `gI` - Insert text at the beginning of the line, no matter what the first characters are.
* `ga` - Print the ascii value of the character under the cursor in decimal, hexadecimal or octal.
* `gu` - Lowercase using a motion.
** for example, `guiw`.

or written.

[]
* To write to register `a`:

** Yank, change or delete some content to write it to register `a`.
*** for example, by using `dd` in normal mode.

[]
* To read from a register `a`:
** Hit `"a` in NORMAL mode to specify what register you want to read.
** Use a put keystroke in NORMAL mode to spit out the content of the register in your current buffer.
*** An example of a put keystroke is a `P` or `p` command.

[]
* `Ctrl+R<reg>` - to paste the content of register `<reg>` in insert mode or command line mode.
