== Azure Monitor

=== Overview

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-solution-monitoring-logging/media/m09-l01-monitoring-logging-azure-monitor-overview-7616d1b6.png[]


* The above diagram gives a high-level view of Azure Monitor. 
* At the center of the diagram are the data stores for metrics and logs, which are the two fundamental types of data used by Azure Monitor.
* On the left are the sources of monitoring data that populate these data stores.
* On the right are the different functions that Azure Monitor performs with this collected data such as analysis, alerting, and streaming to external systems.

=== What data does Azure Monitor collect?

* *Application monitoring data*: Data about the performance and functionality of the code you have written, regardless of its platform.
* *Guest OS monitoring data*: Data about the operating system on which your application is running. This OS could be running in Azure, another cloud, or on-premises.
* *Azure resource monitoring data*: Data about the operation of an Azure resource.
* *Azure subscription monitoring data*: Data about the operation and management of an Azure subscription, as well as data about the health and operation of Azure itself.
* *Azure tenant monitoring data*: Data about the operation of tenant-level Azure services, such as Azure Active Directory.

[]
* As soon as you create an Azure subscription and start adding resources such as virtual machines and web apps, Azure Monitor starts collecting data. 
* Activity logs record when resources are created or modified. 
* Metrics tell you how the resource is performing and the resources that it's consuming.

=== Alerts

* Alerts in Azure Monitor proactively notify you of critical conditions and potentially attempt to take corrective action.

The diagram below represents the flow of alerts.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-solution-monitoring-logging/media/m09-l01-monitoring-logging-alerts-flow-52464b0e.png[]

Alert rules are separated from alerts and the actions taken when an alert fires.

The alert rule captures the target and criteria for alerting.

The alert rule can be in an enabled or a disabled state.

Alerts only fire when enabled.

The following are key attributes of an alert rule:

* Target Resource 
** Defines the scope and signals available for alerting.
** A target can be any Azure resource.
** Example targets: a virtual machine, a storage account, a virtual machine scale set, a Log Analytics workspace, or an Application Insights resource
** For certain resources (like virtual machines), you can specify multiple resources as the target of the alert rule.
* Signal
** Emitted by the target resource.
** Signals can be of the following types: metric, activity log, Application Insights, and log.
* Criteria
**  A combination of signal and logic applied on a target resource. Examples:
*** Percentage CPU > 70%
*** Server Response Time > 4 ms
*** Result count of a log query > 100
* Alert Name
** A specific name for the alert rule configured by the user.
* Alert Description
** A description for the alert rule configured by the user.
* Severity
**  The severity of the alert after the criteria specified in the alert rule is met. Severity can range from 0 to 4.
*** Sev 0 = Critical
*** Sev 1 = Error
*** Sev 2 = Warning
*** Sev 3 = Informational
*** Sev 4 = Verbose
* Action
** A specific action taken when the alert is fired.

=== IoT Hub metrics

=== Resource Logs and Content

You can send the resource logs that Azure Monitor generates to Azure Monitor logs, Event Hubs, or Azure Storage for custom processing.

Choose where you want to send the logs. You can select any combination of the three options:

* Archive to a storage account
* Stream to an Event Hubs
* Send to Log Analytics

Azure Monitor tracks different operations that occur in IoT Hub.

Each category has a schema that defines how events in that category are reported.

* Connections
** The connections category tracks device connect and disconnect events from an IoT hub and errors.
** This category is useful for identifying unauthorized connection attempts and/or alerting you when the connection to devices is lost.

=== Read logs from Azure Event Hubs
After you set up event logging through diagnostics settings, you can create applications that read out the logs so that you can take action based on the information in them.

This sample code retrieves logs from an Event Hubs:

[source,csharp]
----
class Program
{
    static string connectionString = "{your AMS eventhub endpoint connection string}";
    static string monitoringEndpointName = "{your AMS Event Hubs endpoint name}";
    static EventHubClient eventHubClient;
    //This is the Diagnostic Settings schema
    class AzureMonitorDiagnosticLog
    {
        string time { get; set; }
        string resourceId { get; set; }
        string operationName { get; set; }
        string category { get; set; }
        string level { get; set; }
        string resultType { get; set; }
        string resultDescription { get; set; }
        string durationMs { get; set; }
        string callerIpAddress { get; set; }
        string correlationId { get; set; }
        string identity { get; set; }
        string location { get; set; }
        Dictionary<string, string> properties { get; set; }
    };

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Monitoring. Press Enter key to exit.\n");
        eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, monitoringEndpointName);
        var d2cPartitions = eventHubClient.GetRuntimeInformationAsync().PartitionIds;
        CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        var tasks = new List<Task>();
        foreach (string partition in d2cPartitions)
        {
            tasks.Add(ReceiveMessagesFromDeviceAsync(partition, cts.Token));
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
        Console.WriteLine("Exiting...");
        cts.Cancel();
        Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());
    }

    private static async Task ReceiveMessagesFromDeviceAsync(string partition, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var eventHubReceiver = eventHubClient.GetDefaultConsumerGroup().CreateReceiver(partition, DateTime.UtcNow);
        while (true)
        {
            if (ct.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                await eventHubReceiver.CloseAsync();
                break;
            }
            EventData eventData = await eventHubReceiver.ReceiveAsync(new TimeSpan(0,0,10));
            if (eventData != null)
            {
                string data = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.GetBytes());
                Console.WriteLine("Message received. Partition: {0} Data: '{1}'", partition, data);
                var deserializer = new JavaScriptSerializer();
                //deserialize json data to azure monitor object
                AzureMonitorDiagnosticLog message = new JavaScriptSerializer().Deserialize<AzureMonitorDiagnosticLog>(result);
            }
        }

=== IoT Hub Service Health Monitoring

Use Azure Resource Health to monitor whether your IoT hub is up and running.

You can also learn whether a regional outage is impacting the health of your IoT hub.

== Device Connection State and Lifecycle Notifications

Device events enable you to keep your solution healthy.

=== Device heartbeat

* Knowing whether a device is connected at a particular moment is not as easy as you may think. 
* Continuously testing the connection would be a waste of resources and in some cases, such as low power devices that enter a sleep mode for extended intervals, could be impossible.
* The IoT Hub identity registry contains a field called *connectionState*, but IoT solutions should not query this field at run time.
* Only use the connectionState field during development and debugging.
* For example, do not query the *connectionState* field to check if a device is connected before you send a cloud-to-device message or an SMS.
* We recommend subscribing to the device disconnected event on Event Grid to get alerts and monitor the device connection state.
* If your IoT solution needs to know if a device is connected, you can implement the _heartbeat_ pattern.
* In the heartbeat pattern, the device sends device-to-cloud messages at least once every fixed amount of time (for example, at least once every hour)
* When this pattern is implemented, even if a device does not have any data to send, it still sends an empty device-to-cloud message (usually with a property that identifies it as a heartbeat).
* On the service side, the solution maintains a map with the last heartbeat received for each device.
* If the solution does not receive a heartbeat message within the expected time from the device, it assumes that there is a problem with the device.
* A more complex implementation could include the information from Azure Monitor and Azure Resource Health to identify devices that are trying to connect or communicate but failing.
* When you implement the heartbeat pattern, make sure to check IoT Hub Quotas and Throttles.

=== Device and module lifecycle notifications

* IoT Hub can notify your IoT solution when an identity is created or deleted by sending lifecycle notifications.
* To do so, your IoT solution needs to create a route and to set the Data Source equal to *DeviceLifecycleEvents* or *ModuleLifecycleEvents*.
* By default, no lifecycle notifications are sent, that is, no such routes pre-exist.
* The notification message includes properties, and body.
* Properties: Message system properties are prefixed with the /$ symbol.

* This field represents the IoT Hub view of the device connection status.
* _Important_: This field should be used only for development/debugging purposes. 
* The connection state is updated only for devices using MQTT or AMQP. 
* Also, it is based on protocol-level pings (MQTT pings, or AMQP pings), and it can have a maximum delay of only 5 minutes. 
* For these reasons, there can be false positives, such as devices reported as connected but that are disconnected.
