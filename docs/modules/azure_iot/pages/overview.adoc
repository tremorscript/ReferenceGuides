== Subsystems of IoT

=== Core Subsystems
An IoT solution architecture consists of the following subsystems:

* Devices securely connecting to the cloud.
* Devices sending and receiving data from the cloud.
* A cloud gateway service, or hub, that provides device management capabilities.
* The cloud gateway service, or hub, must securely accept data from the devices.
* Stream processors consume data from the hub.
* Stream processors also integrate with business processes.
* They also place the data into storage.
* A user interface to visualize telemetry data and facilitate device management.

Below diagram illustrates the core subsystems of IoT

=== Optional Subsystems
Many IoT apps will include subsystems for the following:

* *IoT Edge Devices* to manage access and information flow
* They may help with device provisioning, data filtering, batching and aggregation, buffering of data, protocol translation, event rules processing etc.
* *Data Transformation Subsystem* for manipulation and aggregation of the telemetry stream either before or after it is received by the cloud gateway service (the IoT hub).
* Manipulation can include protocol transformation (for example, converting binary data to json) etc.
* *Bulk Device Provisioning* for deploying fleet of devices.
* *User Management Subsystem* for specifying groups and users who can perform action on devices (for example, updating firmware etc).
* *ML Subsystem* to learn from data and experiences and to act without being explicitly programmed.
* Hot/warm/cold *storage* paths.

== Data flow and processing
There are four categories of stages (storage, routing, analysis, action/display):

* Storage includes in-memory caches, temp queues and permanent archives(database).
* Routing makes the decision on what data should go to which target and when. Targets include storage, analysis processes and action.
* Analyis is used to run the data records through a set of conditions and can produce different output data records.
* Original data records and post-analysis output data records are stored and available for display and may trigger actions such as sending email, sms etc.

== IoT Hardware componenents

[discrete]
=== IP-enabled IoT devices
An IP-enabled device is, simply, a device that can establish a connection to a network and have a unique identity on that network. +
IP-enabled devices are deployed in scenarios where data needs to be collected, delivered, and analyzed in real-time, or periodically.

[discrete]
=== Non-IP enabled devices
A device does not need to be directly IP-enabled in order to be part of the solution. +
They can connect to other devices like a field gateway (IoT Edge device). +
These devices can use protocols like CoAP5, OPC or technologies like Bluetooth, ZigBee to connect to other hardware.

[discrete]
=== Sensors
A sensor is a circuit (or device) that collects a specific type of data about the physical environment. +
A *smart sensor* is a device that gathers input and processes that information locally before communicating message data.

[discrete]
=== IoT Edge devices and field gateways
A *field gateway* is a specialized device-appliance or a general-purpose software that:

* acts as a communication enabler.
* may act as a local device control system and device data processing hub.
* can perform local processing.
* can control functions that are directed back towards the child devices that are connected to it.
* can be used to filter or aggregate device telemetry.

The scope of a field gateway includes the field gateway itself and all devices that are attached to it.

Gateways may help with device provisioning, data filtering, batching and aggregation, buffering of data, protocol translation, and event processing rules.

NAT devices or firewalls do not qualify as field gateways since they are not explicit connection or session terminals, but rather route (or deny) connections or sessions made through them.

== Review Azure IoT technologies

=== Managed aPaaS solutions
Application platform as a service (aPaas) provides a cloud environment to build, manage, and deliver applications to customers.

[discrete]
=== Data storage options
Data is often time-series data. It is common to split data into "warm" and "cold" data stores. +
The *warm data* holds recent data that needs to be accessed with low latency. +
You can decide the duration range (for example, the last day, week, or month) +
Data stored in *cold storage* is historical data.

=== Analytics
Without analytics, data collected from IoT would be too voluminous and unstructured to visualize or gain insights. +
Analytic services enable architects to build meaningful relationships between sets of data in order to make it easier to manage.

=== Data visualization
Data visualization tools can take input from various data streams and combine them into "dashboards" that can be used to tell a story about the data that was collected. +
Ultimately, getting more out of your data is the goal of IoT.

== IoT Hub
IoT Hub is a managed service that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages.

IoT Hub gives you a secure communication channel for your devices to send data

* per-device authentication enables each device to connect securely to IoT hub and be managed securely by IoT hub.
* You can control user device access and per-device level connection.
* IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service automatically provisions devices to the correct IoT Hub when the device first boots up.
* Multiple authentication types:
** SAS token-based authentication.
** Individual X.509 certificate authentication for secure, standards-based authentication.
** X.509 CA authentication for simple, standards-based enrollment.

IoT Hub can scale to millions of devices and can handle millions of events per second.

IoT Hub has *built-in routing* and can setup automatic, rules-based message fan-out:

* Use message routing to control where your hub sends device telemetry.
* Can route messages to multiple endpoints at no extra cost.
* No-code routing rules instead of writing custom message dispatcher code.

IoT Hub can integrate with other services:-

* Azure Event Grid to help your business to quickly react to critical events.
* Azure Logic Apps to automate business processes.
* Azure Machine Learning to add machine learning and AI models.
* Azure Stream Analytics to run real-time analytic computations on the data.

IoT Hub can manage your devices:-

* Store, synchronize, and query device metadata and state information for all your devices.
* Set device state either per-device or based on some common characteristic.
* Automatically respond to a device-reported state change.

Use Azure IoT device SDK libraries to build applications that run on your devices and interact with IoT Hub.

There is a limit of 50 IoT hubs per subscription. You can request quota increases by contacting support.

== Device Provisioning Service
Provisioning is a two part process:

* The first part is establishing the initial connection between the device and the IoT solution by registering the device.
* The second part is applying the proper configuration to the device based on the requirements of the solution it was registered to.

Features:-

* Secure attestation support for both X.509 and TPM-based identities
* Multiple allocation policies to control how the DPS assigns devices to IoT hubs.
* Monitoring and diagnostic logging
* Mult-hub support allows DPS to assign devices to more than one IoT hub across subscriptions.
* Cross-region support to assign devices in other regions.

When to use:-

* Zero-touch provisioning to an IoT solution without hardcoding IoT Hub connection.
* Load-balancing devices across multiple hubs.
* Connecting devices to a particular IoT solution depending on use case.
* Connecting a device to the IoT hub with the lowest latency.
* Reprovisioning based on a change in the device.
* Rolling the keys used by the device to connect to IoT Hub.

== IoT Hub properties

=== IoT Hub Tiers
To evaluate which IoT Hub tier is right for you solution, consider the following two questions:

* What features do I plan to use?
* How much data do I plan to move daily?

==== Basic Tier
The basic tier enables a subset of features and is intended for IoT solutions that only need uni-directional communication from devices to the cloud. +
If your IoT solution is based around collecting data from devices and analyzing it centrally, then the basic tier is probably right for you.

==== Standard Tier
The standard tier of IoT Hubs enables all features, and is required for any IoT solutions that want to make use of the bi-directional communication capabilities. +
If you would like to control IoT devices remotely or distribute some of your workloads onto the devices themselves, then you should consider the standard tier.

==== Message throughtput
Message traffic is measured for your IoT hub on a per-unit basis. +
When you create an IoT hub, you choose its tier and edition, and set the number of units available. +
You can purchase up to 200 units for the B1, B2, S1, or S2 edition, or up to 10 units for the B3 or S3 edition.

|===
|Tier edition |Sustained throughput |Sustained send rate

|B1, S1 
|Up to 1111 KB/minute per unit (1.5 GB/day/unit) 
|Average of 278 messages/minute per unit (400,000 messages/day per unit) 

|B2, S2 
|Up to 16 MB/minute per unit (22.8 GB/day/unit) 
|Average of 4,167 messages/minute per unit (6 million messages/day per unit)

|B3, S3 
|Up to 814 MB/minute per unit (1144.4 GB/day/unit) 
|Average of 208,333 messages/minute per unit (300 million messages/day per unit)
|===

==== Partitions
Partions can be used to reduce contentions that could occur when concurrently reading and writing to event streams. +
The partition limit is chosen when IoT hub is created. +
The maximum partition limit is 32 but most IoT hubs only need 4 partitions. +
The number of partitions is directly related to the number of concurrent readers you expect to have.

The default value of four partitions should be used unless specified by the architect.

==== Tier upgrade
You can upgrade from the basic tier to the standard tier without interrupting your existing operations.
You cannot downgrade to a lower tier. You can move from S2 to S1 but not from S1 to B1 tier.

=== IoT Hub endpoints
An endpoint is a service that can retrieve data from other services. +
Examples of endpoint types:

* *Device-facing endpoints* that enables devices to perform operations such as sending device-to-cloud messages and receiving cloud-to-device messages.
* *Service-facing management endpoints* that enable back-end apps to perform operations such as device identity management and device twin management.
* *Service facing built-in endpoints* for reading device-to-cloud messages.
* *Custom endpoints* to receive device-to-cloud messages dispatched by a routing rule.

==== Built-in endpoints

.Source Microsoft Learn

The IoT hub endpoints:

* *Resource provider*. It exposes an Azure Resource Manager interface. This interface enables Azure subscription owners to create and delete IoT hubs, and to update IoT hub properties.
* *Device identity management*. A set of HTTPS REST endpoints to manage device identities. Device identities are used for device authentication and access control.
* *Device twin management*. A set of HTTPS REST endpoints to query and update device twins.
* *Jobs management* HTTS REST endpoint to query and manage jobs.
* *Device endpoints*. For each device, a set of endpoints are exposed
** Send device-to-cloud messages
** Receive cloud-to-device messages
** Initiate file uploads - a device uses this endpoint to receive an Azure storage SAS URI from IoT Hub to upload a file.
** Retrieve and update device twin properties.
** Receive direct method requests.
* *Service endpoints*. Exposes a set of endpoints for your solution back end to communicate with your devices. With one exception, these endpoints are only exposed using the AMQP protocols. The method invocation endpoint is exposed over the HTTPS protocol.
** Receive device-to-cloud messages.
** Send cloud-to-device messages and receive delivery acknowledgements.
** Receive file notifications.
** Direct method invocation.
** Receive operation monitoring events.

==== Custom endpoints
These endpoints act as service endpoints and are used as sinks for message routes. +
Devices cannot write directly to these custom endpoints.

The following services are supported as custom endpoints.

* Azure Storage containers
* Event Hubs
* Service Bus Queues
* Service Bus Topics

== Security Concepts
There are three different ways for controlling access to IoT Hub:

* *Azure AD*. It provides identity-based authentication and fine-grained authorization with Azure RBAC. It supports only IoT hub service api's.
* *SAS*. It lets you group permissions and grant them to applications using access keys and signed security tokens.
* *Per-device security credentials*. Each IoT Hub contains an identity registry. For each device in this registry, you can configure security credentials that grant DeviceConnect permissions scoped to the device's endpoints.

=== Access Control and Permissions
Use shared access policies for IoT hub-level access. +
Use the individual device credentials to scope access to that device only.

=== Authentication
Azure IoT hub grants access to endpoints by verifying a token against the shared access policies and identity registry security credentials.

=== Security tokens
IoT Hub uses security tokens to authenticate devices and services to avoid sending keys on the wire. +
Security tokens are limited in time validity and scope. +
Some scenarios do require you to use security tokens directly. Example:

* The direct use of the MQTT, AMQP, or HTTPS surfaces.
* The implementation of the token service pattern.

IoT hub also allows devices to authenticate with IoT Hub using X.509 certificates.

=== Supported X.509 certificates
You can verify using X.509 certificates by uploading either a certificate thumbprint or a certificate authority(CA) to Azure IoT Hub. +
Authentication using certificate thumbprints only verifies that the presented thumbprint matches the configured thumbprint. +
Authentication using certificate authority validates the certificate chain.

Supported Certificates include:

* An existing X.509 certificate. A device may already have a certificate that it can then use to authenticate. Works with either thumbprint or CA authentication.
* CA-signed X.509 certificate. You can use a Certificate Authority signed certificate. Works with either thumbprint or CA authentication.
* A self generated and self-signed X.509 certificate. A device manufacturer or in-house deployer can generate these certificates and store the corresponding private key (and certificate) on the device. You can use tools such as OpenSSL and Windows SelfSignedCertificate utility for this purpose. Only works with thumbprint authentication.

A device may either use an X.509 certificate or a security token for authentication, but not both.
