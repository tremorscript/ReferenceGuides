== Core Subsystems of IoT
An IoT solution architecture consists of the following subsystems:

* Devices securely connecting to the cloud.
* Devices sending and receiving data from the cloud.
* A cloud gateway service, or hub, that provides device management capabilities.
* A cloud gateway service, or hub, that securely accepts data from the devices.
* Stream processors that consume data from the hub.
* Stream processors can integrate with business processes.
* Stream processors can place the data into storage.
* A user interface to visualize telemetry data and to facilitate device management.

Below diagram illustrates the core subsystems of IoT

== Optional Subsystems of IoT
Many IoT apps will also include subsystems for the following:

* *IoT Edge Devices* to manage access and information flow
* *IoT Edge Devices* may help with device provisioning, data filtering, batching and aggregation, buffering of data, protocol translation, event rules processing etc.
* *Data Transformation Subsystem* for manipulation and aggregation of the telemetry stream either before or after it is received by the cloud gateway service (the IoT hub).
* *Bulk Device Provisioning* for deploying a fleet of devices.
* *User Management Subsystem* for specifying groups and users who can perform action on devices (for example, updating firmware etc).
* *ML Subsystem* to learn from data and experiences and to act without being explicitly programmed.
* *Hot/Warm/Cold Storage* paths.

== Data flow and Processing
There are four categories of stages (storage, routing, analysis, action/display):

* *Storage* includes in-memory caches, temp queues and databases.
* *Routing* makes the decision on what data should go to which target and when. Targets include storage, analysis processes and action.
* *Analysis* is used to run the data records through a set of conditions and can produce different output data records.
* Data records are stored and available for *display* and may trigger *actions* such as sending email, sms etc.

=== Data flow Scenarios

== IoT Hardware Components

== IP-enabled IoT Devices

* An IP-enabled device is a device that can establish a connection to a network.
* It has a unique identity on that network.
* They are deployed in scenarios where data needs to be collected, delivered, and analyzed in real-time, or periodically.


=== Non-IP enabled Devices

* These devices connect to a field gateway (IoT Edge device).
* These devices can use protocols like CoAP5, OPC or technologies like Bluetooth, ZigBee to connect to an edge device.

=== Sensors

* A sensor is a circuit (or device) that collects a specific type of data about the physical environment.
* A *smart sensor* is a device that gathers the input and then processes that information locally before forwarding the data.

=== IoT Edge Devices and Field Gateways

* A *field gateway* is a specialized device-appliance or a general-purpose software that:
** acts as a communication enabler.
** may act as a local device control system.
** can perform local processing.
** can control functions that are directed back towards the child devices that are connected to it.
** can be used to filter or aggregate device telemetry.
** may help with device provisioning, buffering of data, protocol translation, and event processing rules.

== Review Azure IoT Technologies

=== Analytics

* Data collected from IoT is too voluminous and unstructured to visualize or gain insights.
* Analytic services enable architects to build meaningful relationships between sets of data in order to make it easier to manage.


=== Data visualization

* Data visualization tools can take input from various data streams and combine them into "dashboards" that can be used to tell a story about the data that was collected.

== IoT Hub

=== Security

* IoT Hub is a managed service that acts as a central message hub for *bi-directional communication* between your IoT application and the devices it manages.
* Per-device authentication enables each device to connect securely to IoT hub and be managed securely by IoT hub.
* You can control user device access and per-device level connection.
* IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service automatically provisions devices to the correct IoT Hub when the device first boots up.
* Multiple authentication types:
** SAS token-based authentication.
** Individual X.509 certificate authentication for secure, standards-based authentication.
** X.509 CA authentication for simple, standards-based enrollment.


=== Routing

* IoT Hub has *built-in routing* and can setup automatic, rules-based message fan-out:
** Use message routing to control where your hub sends device telemetry.
** Can route messages to multiple endpoints at no extra cost.
** No-code routing rules instead of writing custom message dispatcher code.

=== Integration

* IoT Hub can integrate with other services:-
** Azure Event Grid to help your business to quickly react to critical events.
** Azure Logic Apps to automate business processes.
** Azure Machine Learning to add machine learning and AI models.
** Azure Stream Analytics to run real-time analytic computations on the data.


=== Device Management

* IoT Hub can manage your devices:-
** Store, synchronize, and query device metadata and state information for all your devices.
** Set device state either per-device or based on some common characteristic.
** Automatically respond to a device-reported state change.

=== Developer

* Use Azure IoT device SDK libraries to build applications that run on your devices and interact with IoT Hub.
* There is a limit of 50 IoT hubs per subscription. You can request quota increases by contacting support.

== Device Provisioning Service

=== Provisioning Process

* Provisioning is a two part process:
** The first part is establishing the initial connection between the device and the IoT solution by registering the device.
** The second part is applying the proper configuration to the device based on the requirements of the solution it was registered to.

=== Features

* Secure attestation support for both X.509 and TPM-based identities
* Multiple allocation policies to control how the DPS assigns devices to IoT hubs.
* Monitoring and diagnostic logging
* Mult-hub support allows DPS to assign devices to more than one IoT hub across subscriptions.
* Cross-region support to assign devices in other regions.

=== When to use

* Zero-touch provisioning to an IoT solution without hardcoding IoT Hub connection.
* Load-balancing devices across multiple hubs.
* Connecting devices to a particular IoT solution depending on use case.
* Connecting a device to the IoT hub with the lowest latency.
* Reprovisioning based on a change in the device.
* Rolling the keys used by the device to connect to IoT Hub.


== IoT Hub Tiers

* To evaluate which IoT Hub tier is right for you solution, consider the following two questions:
** What features do I plan to use?
** How much data do I plan to move daily?

=== Basic Tier

* This tier enables features for solutions that only need uni-directional communication from devices to the cloud.
* If your IoT solution is based around collecting data from devices and analyzing it centrally, then the basic tier is probably right for you.

=== Standard Tier

* This tier of IoT Hubs enables features for solutions that want to make use of the bi-directional communication capabilities.
* If you would like to control IoT devices remotely or distribute some of your workloads onto the devices themselves, then you should consider the standard tier.


== Message Throughtput Basics
* Message traffic is measured for your IoT hub on a per-unit basis.
* When you create an IoT hub, you choose its tier and edition, and set the number of units available.
* You can purchase up to 200 units for the B1, B2, S1, or S2 edition, or up to 10 units for the B3 or S3 edition.

|===
|Tier edition |Sustained throughput |Sustained send rate

|B1, S1 
|Up to 1111 KB/minute per unit (1.5 GB/day/unit) 
|Average of 278 messages/minute per unit (400,000 messages/day per unit) 

|B2, S2 
|Up to 16 MB/minute per unit (22.8 GB/day/unit) 
|Average of 4,167 messages/minute per unit (6 million messages/day per unit)

|B3, S3 
|Up to 814 MB/minute per unit (1144.4 GB/day/unit) 
|Average of 208,333 messages/minute per unit (300 million messages/day per unit)
|===

== Partition Basics

* Partions can be used to reduce contentions that could occur when concurrently reading and writing to event streams. 
* The partition limit is chosen when IoT hub is created.
* The maximum partition limit is 32 but most IoT hubs only need 4 partitions.
* The number of partitions is directly related to the number of concurrent readers you expect to have.
* The default value of four partitions should be used unless specified by the architect.

== IoT Hub Endpoint Basics
* An endpoint is a service that can retrieve data from other services.
* Examples of endpoint types:
** *Device-facing endpoints* that enables devices to perform operations such as sending device-to-cloud messages and receiving cloud-to-device messages.
** *Service-facing management endpoints* that enable back-end apps to perform operations such as device identity management and device twin management.
** *Service facing built-in endpoints* for reading device-to-cloud messages.
** *Custom endpoints* to receive device-to-cloud messages dispatched by a routing rule.

[discrete]
=== Built-in endpoints

'''

The IoT hub endpoints:

* *Resource provider*. It exposes an Azure Resource Manager interface. This interface enables Azure subscription owners to create and delete IoT hubs, and to update IoT hub properties.
* *Device identity management*. A set of Https REST endpoints to manage device identities. Device identities are used for device authentication and access control.
* *Device twin management*. A set of Https REST endpoints to query and update device twins.
* *Jobs management*. Https REST endpoint to query and manage jobs.
* *Device endpoints*. For each device, a set of endpoints are exposed
** Send device-to-cloud messages.
** Receive cloud-to-device messages.
** Initiate file uploads - a device uses this endpoint to receive an Azure storage SAS URI from IoT Hub to upload a file.
** Retrieve and update device twin properties.
** Receive direct method requests.
* *Service endpoints*. Exposes a set of endpoints for your solution back end to communicate with your devices. With one exception, these endpoints are only exposed using the AMQP protocols. The method invocation endpoint is exposed over the Https protocol.
** Receive device-to-cloud messages.
** Send cloud-to-device messages and receive delivery acknowledgements.
** Receive file notifications.
** Direct method invocation.
** Receive operation monitoring events.

[discrete]
=== Custom endpoints

'''
* These endpoints act as service endpoints and are used as sinks for message routes.
* Devices cannot write directly to these custom endpoints.
* The following services are supported as custom endpoints.
** Azure Storage containers
** Event Hubs
** Service Bus Queues
** Service Bus Topics

== Security Concepts
There are three different ways for controlling access to IoT Hub:

* *Azure AD* - It provides identity-based authentication and fine-grained authorization with Azure RBAC. It supports only IoT hub service api's.
* *SAS* - It lets you group permissions and grant them to applications using access keys and signed security tokens.
* *Per-device security credentials* - Each IoT Hub contains an identity registry. For each device in this registry, you can configure security credentials that grant DeviceConnect permissions scoped to the device's endpoints.

[discrete]
=== Access Control and Permissions

'''
* Use shared access policies for IoT hub-level access.
* Use the individual device credentials to scope access to that device only.

[discrete]
=== Authentication

'''
* Azure IoT hub grants access to endpoints by verifying a token against the shared access policies and identity registry security credentials.

[discrete]
=== Security tokens

'''
* IoT Hub uses security tokens to authenticate devices and services to avoid sending keys on the wire.
* Security tokens are limited in time validity and scope.
* Some scenarios do require you to use security tokens directly. Example:
** The direct use of the MQTT, AMQP, or HTTPS surfaces.
** The implementation of the token service pattern.
* IoT hub also allows devices to authenticate with IoT Hub using X.509 certificates.

[discrete]
=== Supported X.509 certificates

'''
* You can verify using X.509 certificates by uploading either a certificate thumbprint or a certificate authority (CA) to Azure IoT Hub.
* Authentication using certificate thumbprints only verifies that the presented thumbprint matches the configured thumbprint.
* Authentication using certificate authority validates the certificate chain.
* Supported Certificates include:
** *An existing X.509 certificate*. A device may already have a certificate that it can then use to authenticate. Works with either thumbprint or CA authentication.
** *CA-signed X.509 certificate*. You can use a Certificate Authority signed certificate. Works with either thumbprint or CA authentication.
** *A self generated and self-signed X.509 certificate*. A device manufacturer or in-house deployer can generate these certificates and store the corresponding private key (and certificate) on the device. You can use tools such as OpenSSL and Windows SelfSignedCertificate utility for this purpose. Only works with thumbprint authentication.
* A device may either use an X.509 certificate or a security token for authentication, but not both.

== IoT Device Lifecycle Terms and Concepts
For Azure IoT, there are five stages within the device lifecycle:

* *Plan*: Enable operators to create a device metadata scheme that enables them to query for, and target a group of devices for bulk management operations. You can use the device twin to store this device metadata in the form of tags and properties.
* *Provision*: Securely provision new devices to IoT Hub and enable operators to immediately discover device capabilities.
* *Configure*: Facilitate bulk configuration changes and firmware updates to devices while maintaining both health and security.
* *Monitor*: Monitor overall device collection health, the status of ongoing operations, and alert operators to issues that might require attention.
* *Retire*: Replace or decommission devices after a failure, upgrade cycle, or at the end of the service lifetime.

== Device Identity and Registration

[discrete]
=== Identity Registry

'''
* A device must have an entry in the IoT Hub identity registry before it can connect to an IoT Hub.
* The deviceID is case-sensitive.
* The identity registry is a REST-capable collection of device identity resources.
* IoT Hub creates a set of resources for every device in the identity registry such as the queue that contains in-flight cloud-to-device messages.
* Use the identity registry when you need to:
** Provision devices that connect to your IoT hub.
** Control per-device access to your hub's device-facing endpoints.


[discrete]
=== Module Identity

'''
* You can create module identities under a device identity.
* Each module identity can be configured with an independent connection to IoT hub.
* You can seperate access control permissions.
* You can create up to 20 module identites under a device identity.

[discrete]
=== Identity registry operations

'''
* Identity registry exposes the following operations:
** Create device or module identity
** Update device or module identity
** Retreive device or module identity
** Delete device or module identity
** List up to 1000 identities
** Export device identities to Azure blob storage
** Import device identities from Azure blob storage

[discrete]
=== Device Creation

'''
* You need to specify the Device ID and the authentication type when creating a new device.

== Device Twins Concept

* Device Twins are json documents managed by IoT Hub that store device state information associated with a physical device.
* This information includes metadata, configurations, and conditions.
* Azure IoT Hub maintains a device twin for each registered device.
* Device twins are implicity created and deleted when a device identity is created or deleted in IoT Hub.
* A device twin is a JSON document that includes:
** _Tags_. A solution back end can read from and write to. Tags are not visible to device apps.
** _Desired properties_. The solution back end can set desired properties, and the device app can read them. The device app can also receive notifications of changes in the desired properties.
** _Reported properties_. The device app can set reported properties, and the solution back end can read and query them.
** _Device identity properties_. The read-only properties from the corresponding device identity stored in the identity registry

[discrete]
===  Usage

'''
Use device twins to:

* Store device-specific metadata in the cloud. For example, the deployment location of a vending machine.
* Report current state information such as available capabilities and conditions from your device app. For example, a device is connected to your IoT hub over cellular or WiFi.
* Synchronize the state of long-running workflows between device app and back-end app. For example, when the solution back end specifies the new firmware version to install, and the device app reports the various stages of the update process.
* Query your device metadata, configuration, or state.

== Module Identity and Module Twins

* Each module identity implicitly generates a module twin.
* Module twins are JSON documents that store module information including metadata, configurations, and conditions.
* SDKs enable you to create modules where each one opens an independent connection to IoT Hub.
* For example, if your vending machine has 3 different sensors controlled by different departments in your company, you can create a module for each sensor.
* This way, each department is only able to create jobs or direct methods for the sensor that they control, avoiding conflicts and user errors.

== Device Monitoring
* Device monitoring is used to track the overall device collection health, the status of ongoing operations, and to alert operators to issues that might require their attention.
* Device twin desired and reported properties can be used to monitor a target condition, target content, or device metrics.
** The Target condition defines the scope of device twins to be updated. It is specified as a query on twin tags and/or reported properties.
** The Target content defines the desired properties to be added or updated in the targeted device twins. The content includes a path to the section of desired properties to be changed.
** The Metrics define the summary counts of various configuration states such as Success, In Progress, and Error.


== Device Retirements

* Use the IoT Hub identity registry for securely revoking device identities and credentials.
* You can disable devices by updating the status property of an identity in the identity registry.
* The disable feature is not available for modules.


== Device Configuration and Communication Protocols

== Devices and Device Provisioning

[discrete]
=== Provisioning Process

'''
There are two phases in the provisioning/deployment process for a device:-

* The manufacturing phase in which the device is created and prepared at the factory.
* The cloud setup phase in which the Device Provisioning Service is configured for automated provisioning.

[discrete]
==== Manufacturing Process Phase

'''
* In this phase, the device is programmed with the provisioning service information, 
* This enables it to call the provisioning service to get its connection info/IoT solution assignment when it is switched on.
* Also, in this phase, the manufacturer supplies the device deployer/operator with the identifying key information for the device.
* This identifying information could be an X.509 certificate or the public portion of a trusted platform module.
* These services are offered by many silicon manufacturers today.

[discrete]
==== Cloud setup phase

'''
* This phase is about configuring the cloud for proper automatic provisioning.
* There are two types of users involved
** A device operator - someone who knows how devices are intially set up.
** A solution operator - someonw who knows how devices are to be split among the IoT hubs.
* A one-time initial setup of the provisioning service must occur.
* It is done by the solution operator.
* The device operator then needs to enroll the device.
* The device operator takes the key identifying information from the manufacturer and adds it to the enrollment list.

[discrete]
==== Linked IoT Hubs

'''
* The Device Provisioning Service can only provision devices to IoT hubs that have been linked to it.
* Linking an IoT hub to an instance of the DPS gives the service read/write permissions to the IoT hub's device registry with the link.
* A DPS can register a device ID and set the initial configuration in the device twin.
* Linked IoT hubs may be in any Azure region.
* You may link hubs in other subscriptions to your provisioning service.

[discrete]
==== Allocation policy

'''
* The service level setting that determines how DPS assigns devices to an IoT hub.
* There are there supported policies:
** Evenly weighted distribution. The default setting. Linked IoT hubs are equally likely to have devices provisioned to them.
** Lowest Latency. Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub with the lowest latency.
** Static Configuration via the enrollment list: specification of the desired IoT hub in the enrollment list takes priority over the service-level allocation policy.
** Custom (Use Azure Function): A custom allocation policy using custom code in an Azure function.

[discrete]
==== Enrollment

'''
* An enrollment is the record of devices that may register through autoprovisioning.
* Two types of enrollments are supported:
** Group enrollment: Recommended for a large number of devices that share a desired initial configuration, or for devices all going to the same tenant.
** Individual enrollment: Recommended for devices that require unique initial configurations, or for devices that can only authenticate using SAS tokens via TPM attestation.
* Enrollment record contains information about the device or group of devices:
** The attestation mechanism used by the device.
** The optional intial desired configuration.
** Desired IoT hub.
** The desired device ID.

[discrete]
==== Registration

'''
* A registration is the record of a device successfully registering/provisioning to an IoT Hub via the Device Provisioning Service.
* Registration records are created automatically; they can be deleted, but they cannot be updated.

[discrete]
==== Operations
* Operations are the billing unit of the Device Provisioning Service.
* One operation is the successful completion of one instruction to the service.
* Operations include device registrations and re-registrations; service-side changes such as adding enrollment list entries, and updating enrollment list entries.

== Device Enrollment Concepts
* The manufacturer is responsible for encoding the device identity info, and the Device Provisioning Service registration URL.

[discrete]
=== ID Scope

'''
* The ID scope is assigned to a DPS when it is created by the user.
* It is used to uniquely identify the specific provisioning service the device will register through.
* The ID scope is generated by the service and is immutable, which guarantees uniquess.

[discrete]
=== Registration ID

'''
* The registration ID uniquely identifies a device in the Device Provisioning Service.
* The registration ID must be unique in the provisioning service ID scope.
* Each device must have a registration ID.
* The registration ID is alphanumeric, case insensitive, and may contain special characters including colon, period, underscore, and hyphen.
* When TPM attestation is used, the registration ID is provided by the TPM itself.
* When X.509-based attestation is used, the registration ID is provided by the subject name of the certificate.

[discrete]
=== Device ID

'''
* The device ID is the ID as it appears in IoT Hub.
* The desired ID may be set in the enrollment entry.
* Setting the desired ID is only supported in individual enrollments.
* If no desired device ID is specified in the enrollment list, the registration ID is used as the device ID when registering the device.

[discrete]
=== Attestation mechanism

'''
* An attestation mechanism is a method used for confirming a device's identity.
* IoT Hub uses "authentication scheme" for a similar concept in that service.
* The DPS supports the following forms of attestation:
** X.509 certificates based on the standard X.509 certificate authentication flow.
** Trusted Platform Module (TPM) based on a nonce challenge, using the TPM standard for keys to present a signed Shared Access Signature (SAS) token. TPM attestation does not require a physical TPM on the device, but the service expects to attest using the endorsement key per the TPM spec.
** Symmetric Key based on shared access signature (SAS) security tokens, which include a hashed signature and an embedded expiration.
* A hardware Security Module (HSM) is recommended for secure, hardware-based storage of device secrets, and is the most secure form of secret storage.
* Both X.509 certificates and SAS tokens can be stored in HSM.

== Device Enrollment Types

[discrete]
=== Individual Enrollments

'''
* It is an entry for a single device that may register.
* Individual enrollments may use X.509 certificates or SAS tokens as attestation mechanisms.
* Individual enrollments may have the desired IoT hub device ID specified.
* Individual enrollments are recommended for devices with unique initial configurations, or for devices that can only use SAS tokens via TPM or virtual TPM as the attestation mechanism.

[discrete]
=== Group Enrollments

'''
* An enrollment group is a group of devices that share a specific attestation mechanism.
* Enrollment groups support both X.509 and symmetric keys.
* All devices in the X.509 enrollment group present X.509 certificates that have been signed by the same root or intermediate Certificate Authority(CA).
* Each device in the symmetric key enrollment group present SAS tokens derived from the group symmetric key.
* The enrollment group name and certificate name must be alphanumeric, lowercase, and may contain hyphens.


== X.509 Certificate Attestation Process

* X.509 certificates are typically arranged in a certificate chain of trust in which each certificate in the chain is signed by the private key of the next higher certificate, and so on, terminating in a self-signed root certificate.
* This arrangement establishes a delegated chain of trust from the root certificate generated by a trusted root certificate authority (CA) down through each intermediate CA to the end-entity "leaf" certificate installed on the device.
* Often the certificate chain represents some logical or physical heirarchy associated with devices.
* For example, a manufacturer may:
** Issue a self-signed root CA certificate.
** Use the root certificate to generate a unique intermediate CA certificate for each factory.
** Use each factory's certificate to generate a unique intermediate CA certificate for each production line in the plant.
** And finally, use the production line certificate to generate a unique device (end-entity) certificate for each device manufactured on the line.

[discrete]
=== Root Certificate

'''
* A root certificate is a self-signed X.509 certificate representing a certificate authority (CA).
* It is the terminus, or trust anchor, of the certificate chain.
* Root certificates can be self-issued by an organization or purchased from a root certificate authority.
* The root certificate can also be referred to as a root CA certificate.

[discrete]
=== Intermediate Certificate

'''
* An intermediate certificate is an X.509 certificate, which has been signed by the root certificate (or by another intermediate certificate with the root certificate in its chain).
* The last intermediate certificate in a chain is used to sign the leaf certificate.

[discrete]
=== End-entity "leaf" certificate

'''
* The leaf certificate, or end-entity certificate, identifies the certificate holder.
* It has the root certificate in its certificate chain and zero or more intermediate certificates.
* The leaf certificate is not used to to sign any other certificates.
* It uniquely identifies the device to the provisioning service and is sometimes referred to as the device certificate.
* During authentication, the device uses the private key associated with its certificate to respond to a proof of possession challenge from the service.
* Leaf certificates used with an Individual enrollment entry have a requirement that the Subject Name must be set to the registration ID of the Individual Enrollment entry.
* Leaf certificates used with an Enrollment group entry should have the Subject Name set to the desired device ID, which will be shown in the Registration Records for the authenticated device in the enrollment group.

== Controlling device access to the provisioning service with X.509 certificates
* The provisioning service exposes two types of enrollment entry that you can use to control access for devices that use the X.509 attestation mechanism:
** Individual enrollment entries are configured with the device certificate associated with a specific device. These entries control enrollments for specific devices.
** Enrollment group entries are associated with a specific intermediate or root CA certificate. These entries control enrollments for all devices that have that intermediate or root certificate in their certificate chain.

[discrete]
=== Process

'''
* When a device connects to a provisioning service, if an individual enrollment for the device exists, the provisioning service applies that entry.
* If there is no individual enrollment for the device and an enrollment group for the first intermediate certificate in the device's certificate chain exists, the service applies that entry, and so on, up the chain to the root. 
* The service applies the first applicable entry such that:
** If the first enrollment entry found is enabled, the service provisions the device.
** If the first enrollment entry found is disabled, the service does not provision the device.
** If no enrollment entry is found for any of the certificates in the device's certificate chain, the service does not provision the device.
* This mechanism and the hierarchical structure of certificate chains provides powerful flexibility in how you can control access for both individual devices and groups of devices.
* For example, imagine five devices with the following certificate:
** Device 1: root certificate -> certificate A -> device 1 certificate
** Device 2: root certificate -> certificate A -> device 2 certificate
** Device 3: root certificate -> certificate A -> device 3 certificate
** Device 4: root certificate -> certificate B -> device 4 certificate
** Device 5: root certificate -> certificate B -> device 5 certificate
* Initially, you can create a single enabled group enrollment entry for the root certificate to enable access for all five devices.
* If certificate B later becomes compromised, you can create a disabled enrollment group entry for certificate B to prevent Device 4 and Device 5 from enrolling.
* If still later Device 3 becomes compromised, you can create a disabled individual enrollment entry for its certificate.
* This revokes access for Device 3, but still allows Device 1 and Device 2 to enroll.

== Hardware Security Module

* The hardware security module, or HSM, is used for secure, hardware based storage of device secrets, and is the most secure form of secret storage.
* Both X.509 certificates and SAS tokens can be stored in the HSM.

[discrete]
=== Trusted Platform Module

'''
* TPM refers to a standard for securely storing keys used to authenticate the platform.
* TPM can also refer to the I/O interface used to interact with the modules implementing the standard.
* TPMs can exist as discrete hardware, integrated hardware, firmware-based, or software-based.
* Device Provisioning service only supports TPM 2.0.
* TPM attestation is based on a nonce challenge, which uses the endorsement and storage root keys to present a signed Shared Access Signature (SAS) token.

[discrete]
=== Endorsement key

'''
* The endorsement key is an asymmetric key contained inside the TPM.
* It is internally generated or injected at manufacture time.
* It is unique for every TPM.
* It cannot be changed or removed.
* The private key portion of the endorsement key is never released outside of the TPM.
* The public portion of the endorsement key is used to recognize a genuine TPM.

[discrete]
=== Storage root key

'''
* The storage root key is stored in the TPM.
* It is used to protect the TPM keys created by applications.
* These cannot be used without the TPM.
* The storage root key is generated when you take ownership of the TPM.
* When you clear the TPM so a new user can take ownership, a new storage root key is generated.

== Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Attestation Process

* TPM attestation uses endorsement key (EK) as the secure root of trust.
* The EK is unique to the TPM.
* Changing the EK changes the device into a new one.
* TPMs have another type of key called the storage root key (SRK).
* An SRK may be generated by the TPMs owner after taking ownership.
* Taking ownership is a way of saying "Someone sets a password on the HSM".
* If a TPM device is sold to a new owner, the new owner can take ownership of the TPM to generate a new SRK.
* The SRK provides a sandbox for the owner to store their keys and provide access revocability if the device or TPM is sold.
* Once a device has been setup, it will have both an SRK and an EK available for use.
* TPM ownership could mean many things, follow the instructions relevant to your system to take ownership.

[discrete]
=== High-level Attestation Process

'''
* The public part of the EK is used by the DPS for device enrollment.
* The device vendor can read the EK_pub and upload it to the provisioning service.
* The device will be recognized when it connects to the DPS.
* The DPS does not check the SRK or owner.
* Clearing the TPM erases customer data and not the EK.
* The device will still be recognized by the DPS when it connects to provision.

[discrete]
=== Detailed Attestation Process

'''
* The device connects to the DPS and requests to provision.
* It provides the service its registration ID, an ID scope, and the EK_pub and SRK_pub from the TPM.
* The service passes the encrypted nonce back to the device.
* The device decrypts the encrypted nonce and uses that to sign a SAS token to connect again and finish provisioning.

[discrete]
=== Nonce challenge

'''
* The device takes the nonce and uses the private portion of the EK and SRK to decrypt the nonce into the TPM.
* The order of nonce encryption delegates trust from the EK, which is immutable, to the SRK, which can change if a new owner takes ownership of the TPM.

[discrete]
=== Validate the nonce and receive credentials

'''
* The device then signs a SAS token using the decrypted nonce.
* It reestablishes connection to the DPS using the signed SAS token.
* With the Nonce challenge completed, the service allows the device to provision.

.Source Microsoft Learn

== Symmetric Key Attestation

* Symmetric key attestation is a simple approach to authenticating a device with DPS.
* Can be used if you do not have strict security requirements.
* It is useful for legacy devices with limited security functionality.

[discrete]
=== Symmetric Key Creation

'''
* The DPS creates new symmetric keys with a default length of 32 bytes when new enrollments are saved with the *Auto generate keys* option enabled.
* You can also specify your own symmetric keys.
* Your keys must have a key length between 16 bytes and 64 bytes.
* The keys must be in valid Base64 format.

[discrete]
=== SAS tokens

'''
SAS tokens have the following form:- +
`SharedAccessSignature sig=\{signature}&se=\{expiry}&skn=\{policyName}&sr=\{URL-encoded-resourceURI}`

* Signature is the HMAC-SHA256 signature string produced by using the symmetric key or the enrollment group key. The key must be decoded from base64 before being used to perform the sha256 computation. The signature result must be url encoded.
* resourceURI is the uri registration endpoint that can be accessed by this token. It starts with the scope ID for the DPS. for example, `{scope ID}/registrations/{registration ID}`
* expiry is the number of seconds since Jan 1970
* url-encoded-resourceURI is the lower case URL-encoding of the lower case resource URI.
* policyName is the name of the shared access policy to which this token refers. The policy name used when provisioning with symmetric key attestation is registration.

== The Device Provisioning Process

* The DPS automates many of the manual steps that are traditionally involved in provisioning devices.

. Device manufacturer adds the device registration information to the enrollment list in the Azure portal.
. Device contacts the DPS set/embedded at the factory. The device passes identifying information to the DPS to prove its identity.
. The DPS validates the identity of the device by validating the registration ID and key against the enrollment list entry using either a nonce challenge (TPM) or X.509 certificates.
. The DPS registers the device with an IoT Hub and populates the device's twin state.
. The IoT hub returns the deviceID information to the provisioning service.
. The DPS returns the IoT hub connection information to the device. The device can now start sending data directly to the IoT hub.
. The device connects to IoT hub.
. The device gets the desired state from its device twin in IoT hub.

== The Autoprovisioning Operation

.Source Microsoft Learn
image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-provisioning-service-terms-concepts/media/m03-l01-auto-provisioning-diagram-aac3c12a.png[]

* *Encode identity and registration URL* - the manufacturer is responsible for encoding the device identity info, and the DPS registration URL
* *Provide device identity* - the manufacturer is responsible for communicating it to the operator or directly enrolling it to the DPS.
* *Configure autoprovisioning* - a one-time configuration of the Azure IoT Hub and IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service instances, establishing them and creating linkage between them.
* *Enroll device identity* - Identity is based on the attestation mechanism the device is designed to use, which allows the provisioning service to attest to the device's authenticity during registration
* *Build/Deploy registration software.* - The Developer is responsible for building and deploying the registration software to the device, using the appropriate SDK.
* *Bootup and register.* - Initiated upon boot up by registration software, which is built using a Device Provisioning Service client SDK appropriate for the device and attestation mechanism. Upon successful registration, the device is provided with its IoT Hub unique device ID and connection information, allowing it to pull its initial configuration and begin the telemetry process.

== The Reprovisioning Process

[discrete]
=== Reprovisioning Scenarios

'''
[horizontal]
Latency:: As a device moves between locations, network latency can be improved by having the device migrated closed to the IoT hub.
Multi-tenancy:: A device may be reassigned to a new customer within an IoT solution. This new customer may use a different IoT hub.
Solution change:: A device could be moved into a new or updated IoT solution. This may require an IoT hub change.
Quarantine:: A device that is malfunctioning, compromised, or out-of-date may be reassigned to an IoT hub that can only update and get back in compliance. Once the device is functioning properly, it's then migrated back to its main hub.

[discrete]
=== Device State Data

'''
* Device state data is composed of the device twin and device capabilities.
* This data is stored in the Device Provisioning Service instance and the IoT hub that a device is assigned to

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-provisioning-service-terms-concepts/media/m03-l01-device-provisioning-service-reprovisioning-state-1-0f06266f.png[]

When a device is initially provisioned with a DPS instance, the following steps are done:

. The device sends a provisioning request to a DPS instance.
.. The service instance authenticates the device identity based on an enrollment entry.
.. It then creates the initial configuration of the device state data.
.. The service instance assigns the device to an IoT hub based on the enrollment configuration.
.. It then returns that IoT hub assignment to the device.
. The provisioning service instance gives a copy of any intial device state data to the assigned IoT hub.
.. The device connects to the assigned IoT hub and begins operations.

[]
* Over time, the device state data on the IoT hub may be updated by device operations and back-end operations.
* The initial device state information stored in the DPS instance stays untouched.
* This untouched device state data is the initial configuration.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-provisioning-service-terms-concepts/media/m03-l01-device-provisioning-service-reprovisioning-state-2-ccaf3d23.png[]

* As a device moves between IoT hubs, it may also be necessary to migrate device state updated on the previous IoT hub over to the new IoT hub.
* This migration is supported by reprovisioning policies in the DPS.

[discrete]
=== Reprovisioning policies

'''
* A device usually supports a method to manually trigger provisioning on demand.
* The reprovisioning policy on an enrollment entry determines how the DPS handles provisioning requests.
* The policy also determines whether device state data should be migrated during reprovisioning.
* The same policies are available for individual enrollments and enrollment groups:


image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-provisioning-service-terms-concepts/media/m03-l01-device-provisioning-service-reprovisioning-state-3-499f65e7.png[]

* Reprovision and migrate data:
** This policy is the default for new enrollment entries.
** This policy takes action when devices associated with the enrollment entry submint a new request (1).
** The updated device state information from that initial IoT hub will be migrated over to the new IoT hub (2).
** During migration, the device's status will be reported as Assigning.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-provisioning-service-terms-concepts/media/m03-l01-device-provisioning-service-reprovisioning-state-4-bb4ef6ea.png[]

* Reprovision and reset to initial config:
** This policy takes action when devices associated with the enrollment entry submit a new provisioning request (1).
** The initial configuration data that the provisioning service instance received when the device was provisioned is provided to the new IoT hub (2).
** During migration, the device's status will be reported as Assigning.
** This policy is often used for a factory reset without changing IoT hubs.

[]
* Never reprovision: The device is never reassigned to a different hub. This policy is provided for managing backwards compatibility.

* Provisioning Device Client SDK
* Provisioning Service Client SDK

[discrete]
=== Provisioning Device SDK

'''
* This SDK supports the following protocols: MQTT, MQTT-WS, AMQP, AMQP-WS, and HTTPS.

== Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Simulator

* In production, TPM is located on the device, either as discrete hardware, integrated hardware, or firmware-based.
* In testing phase, a software-based TPM simulator is provided to developers.
* This simulator is only available on the Windows platform for now.
* Clone the Github repository: `git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java.git`.
* Navigate to the TPM simulator folder under `azure-iot-sdk-java/provisioning/provisioning-tool/tpm-simulator/`.
* Run Simulator.exe prior to running any client application for provisioning device.
* Let the simulator run in the background throughout the provisioning process to obtain registration ID and Endorsement Key. Both values are only valid for one instance of the run.

== X.509 certificate Generator

* For production environment, purchase an X.509 CA certificate from a public root certificate authority.
* For testing environment, you can generate an X.509 root certificate or X.509 certificate chain using:
** OpenSSL: You can use scripts for certificate generation:
*** Node.js
*** Powershell or Bash
** Device Identity Composition Engine (DICE) Enulator: DICE can be used for cryptographic device identity and attestation based on TLS protocol and X.509 client certificates.
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/tutorial-x509-openssl

== Access control to DPS

* The DPS uses permissions to grant access to each endpoint.
* Permissions limit the access to a service instance based on functionality.
* For example, a backend app must include a token that contains security credentials along with every message it sends to the service.
* You can grant permissions in the following ways:
** Shared access authorization policies. Shared access policies can grant any combination of permissions.
** A newly created provisioning service has the `provisioningserviceowner` policy set as the default policy. It is a policy with all permissions.

[discrete]
=== Authentication

* DPS grants access to endpoints by verifying a token against the shared access policies.
* Security credentials, such as symmetric keys, are never sent over the wire.

[discrete]
=== Security tokens

* The DPS uses security tokens to authenticate services to avoid sending keys on the wire.
* Security tokens are limited in time validity and scope.
* DPS SDKs automatically generate tokens without requiring any special configuration.


[discrete]
=== Security Token Structure

* Use security tokens to grant time-bounded access for services to specific functionality in IoT Device Provisioning Service.
* To get authorization to connect to the provisioning service, services must send security tokens signed with either a shared access or symmetric key.
* A token signed with a shared access key grants access to all the functionality associated with the shared access policy permissions.
* The security token has the following format:
** `SharedAccessSignature sig=\{signature}&se=\{expiry}&skn=\{policyName}&sr=\{URL-encoded-resourceURI}`

[discrete]
=== Use security tokens from service components

* Service components can only generate security tokens using shared access policies granting the appropriate permissions.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Endpoint
|Functionality

|\{your-service}.azure-devices-provisioning.net/enrollments
|Provides device enrollment operations with the Device Provisioning Service.

|\{your-service}.azure-devices-provisioning.net/enrollmentGroups
|Provides operations for managing device enrollment groups.

|\{your-service}.azure-devices-provisioning.net/registrations/\{id}
|Provides operations for retrieving and managing the status of device registrations.
|===

* As an example, a service generated using a pre-created shared access policy named `enrollmentread` would create a token with the following parameters:
** resource URI: `\{mydps}.azure-devices-provisioning.net`,
** signing key: one of the keys of the `enrollmentread` policy,
** policy name: `enrollmentread`,
** an expiration time

The result, which would grant access to read all enrollment records, would be:

`SharedAccessSignature sr=mydps.azure-devices-

== Configure Verified CA Certificates

* A verified X.509 Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is a CA certificate that has been uploaded and registered to your provisioning service and has gone through proof-of-possession with the service.

[discrete]
=== Proof-of-Possession Process

'''
. Get a unique verification code generated by the provisioning service for your X.509 CA certificate. You can do this from the Azure portal.
. Create an X.509 verification certificate with the verification code as its subject and sign the certificate with the private key associated with your X.509 certificate.
. Upload the signed verification certificate to the service. The service validates the verification certificate using the public portion of the CA certificate to be verified, thus proving that you are in possession of the CA certificate's private key.

[]
* Verifying certificate ownership ensures the uploader of the certificate is in possession of the certificate's private key.
* Verification prevents a malicious actor sniffing your traffic from extracting an intermediate certificate and using that certificate to create an enrollment group in their own provisioning service, effectively hijacking your devices.
* By proving ownership of the root or an intermediate certificate in a certificate chain, you are proving that you have permission to generate leaf certificates for the devices that will be registering as part of that enrollment group.
* For this reason, the root or intermediate certificate configured in an enrollment group must either be a verified certificate or must roll up to a verified certificate in the certificate chain a device presents when it authenticates with the service.

[discrete]
=== Register and get the verification code

'''
. In the Azure portal, navigate to your provisioning service and open Certificates from the left-hand menu.
. Select Add to add a new certificate.
. Enter a friendly display name for your certificate.
. Browse to your .cer or .pem file that represents the public part of your X.509 certificate.
. Select Upload.
. Once you get a notification that your certificate is successfully uploaded, Select Save.
. Select the certificate that you added in the previous step.
. In Certificate Details, select Generate Verification code.
. The provisioning service creates a verification code that you can use to validate the certificate ownership.
. Copy the code to your clipboard.

[discrete]
=== Digitally sign the verification code to create a verification certificate

'''
* You need to sign the Verification Code with the private key associated with your X.509 CA certificate, which generates a signature.
* This process is known as Proof of possession and results in a signed verification certificate.
* The Azure IoT Hub C SDK provides Powershell (Windows) and Bash (Linux) scripts to help you create CA and leaf certificates for development and to perform proof-of-possession using a verification code.
* You download the files relevant to your system to a working folder and follow the instructions in the Managing CA certificates readme to perform proof-of-possession on a CA certificate.
* The Azure IoT Hub C# SDK contains the Group Certificate Verification Sample, which you can use to do proof-of-possession.
* The Powershell and Bash scripts provided in the documentation and SDKs rely on OpenSSL.
* You may also use OpenSSL or other third-party tools to help you do proof-of-possession.

[discrete]
=== Upload the signed verification certificate

'''
* Upload the resulting signature as a verification certificate to your provisioning service in the portal.
* In Certificate Details on the Azure portal, use the File Explorer icon next to the Verification Certificate .pem or .cer file field to upload the signed verification certificate from your system.
* Once the certificate is successfully uploaded, select Verify. The STATUS of your certificate changes to Verified in the Certificate Explorer list.
* Select Refresh if it does not update automatically.

== Roll Device Certificates
* During the lifecycle of your IoT solution, you will need to roll certificates.
* It could be because of a security breach or certificate expirations.
* Rolling device certificates will involve updating the certificate stored on the device and the IoT hub.
* The device can then reprovision itself with the IoT hub using normal autoprovisioning with the DPS.

[device]
=== Roll the certificate on the device
* Certificates on a device should always be stored in a safe place like a HSM.
* If you are managing your own device certificates, make sure both old and new leaf certificates have the same Common Name (CN).
* By having the same CN, the device can reprovision itself without creating a duplicate registration record.
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/how-to-roll-certificates

== The Deprovisioning process

* You may find it necessary to deprovision devices that were previously autoprovisioned through the DPS.
* For example, a device may be sold or moved to a different IoT hub, or it may be lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised.

Deprovisioning a device involves two steps:

* Disenroll the device from your provisioning service, to prevent future autoprovisioning.
** To learn how to disenroll a device, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/how-to-revoke-device-access-portal
** To learn how to disenroll a device programmatically using one of the provisioning SDKs, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-enroll-device-x509?pivots=programming-language-csharp
** Deregister the device from your IoT Hub, to prevent future communications and data transfer.

The exact steps you take to deprovision a device depends on its attestation mechanism and its applicable enrollment entry with your provisioning service.

Deprovisioning enrollment groups requires you to consider two scenarios:

* To deprovision all of the devices that have been provisioned through an enrollment group:
  . Disable the enrollment group to blocklist its signing certificate.
  . Use the list of provisioned devices for that enrollment group to disable or delete each device from the identity registry of its respective IoT hub
  . After disabling or deleting all devices from their respective IoT hubs, you can optionally delete the enrollment group.
  . Be aware, though, that, if you delete the enrollment group and there is an enabled enrollment group for a signing certificate higher up in the certificate chain of one or more of the devices, those devices can re-enroll.
* To deprovision a single device from an enrollment group:
  . Create a disabled individual enrollment for its leaf (device) certificate.
  . This revokes access to the provisioning service for that device while still permitting access for other devices that have the enrollment group's signing certificate in their chain.
  . Do not delete the disabled individual enrollment for the device.
  . Doing so will allow the device to re-enroll through the enrollment group.
  . Use the list of provisioned devices for that enrollment group to find the IoT hub that the device was provisioned to and disable or delete it from theat hub's identity registry.


== Manage Disenrollment

* Enrollment in the DPS enables a device to be autoprovisioned.
* A provisioned device is one that has been registered with IoT Hub.
* This allows it to receive its initial device twin state and begin reporting telemetry data.

[discrete]
=== Blocklist devices by using an individual enrollment entry

'''
* Individual enrollments apply to a single device.
* It can use either X.509 certificates or SAS tokens as the attestation mechanism.
* Devices that use SAS tokens as their attestation mechanism can be provisioned only through an individual enrollment.
* To blocklist a device that has an individual enrollment, you can either disable or delete its enrollment entry.

To *temporarily* blocklist the device by disabling its enrollment entry:

. Sign in to the Azure portal and select All resources from the left menu.
. In the list of resources, select the provisioning service that you want to blocklist your device from.
. In your provisioning service, select Manage enrollments, and then select the Individual Enrollments tab.
. Select the enrollment entry for the device that you want to blocklist.
. On your enrollment page, scroll to the bottom, and select Disable for the Enable entry switch, and then select Save.  

To *permanently* blocklist the device by deleting its enrollment entry:

. Sign in to the Azure portal and select All resources from the left menu.
. In the list of resources, select the provisioning service that you want to blocklist your device from.
. In your provisioning service, select Manage enrollments, and then select the Individual Enrollments tab.
. Select the check box next to the enrollment entry for the device that you want to blocklist.
. Select Delete at the top of the window, and then select Yes to confirm that you want to remove the enrollment.
. After you finish the procedure, you should see your entry removed from the list of individual enrollments.

[discrete]
=== Blocklist an X.509 intermediate or root CA certificate by using an enrollment group.

'''
* X.509 certificates are typically arranged in a certificate chain of trust.
* If a certificate at any stage in a chain becomes compromised, trust is broken.
* The certificate must be blocklisted to prevent Device Provisioning Service from provisioning devices downstream in any chain that contains that certificate.
* An enrollment group is an entry for devices that share a common attestation mechanism of X.509 certificates signed by the same intermediate or root CA.
* The enrollment group entry is configured with the X.509 certificate associated with the intermediate or root CA.
* The entry is also configured with any configuration values, such as twin state and IoT hub connection, that are shared by devices with that certificate in their certificate chain.
* To blocklist the certificate, you can either disable or delete its enrollment group. 

[discrete]
=== Blocklist specific devices in an enrollment group

'''
* Devices that implement the X.509 attestation mechanism use the device's certificate chain and private key to authenticate.
* When a device connects and authenticates with DPS, the service first looks for an individual enrollment that matches the device's credentials.
* The service then searches enrollment groups to determine whether the device can be provisioned.
* If the service finds a disabled individual enrollment for the device, it prevents the device from connecting.
* The service prevents the connection even if an enabled enrollment group for an intermediate or root CA in the device's certificate chain exists.

== How to provision for multitenancy

* The allocation policies defined by the provisioning service support various allocation scenarios.
** Geolocation/GeoLatency: This policy causes the DPS to evaluate device latency and determine the closest IoT hub out of the group of IoT hubs.
** Multi-tenancy: The solution may require all devices for a particular tenant to communicate with a specific group of IoT hubs.

[]
* Provisioning devices for the multitenant scenario across regions, involves the following:
** Two (or more) regional IoT hubs.
** An enrollment group that uses a multitenant enrollment and specifies assigning devices based on lowest latency.
** Multiple devices provisioned in each region.

* With this configuration in place, you will see that devices in each region are provisioned to the same tenant in the closest region.

== Common Message Format

* To support seamleass interoperability across protocols, IoT Hub defines a common message format for all device-facing protocols.
* This message format is used for both device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messages.
* IoT Hub implements device-to-cloud messaging using a streaming messaging pattern.
* IoT Hub's device-to-cloud messages are more like Event Hubs events than Service Bus messages in that there is a high volume of events passing through the service that can be read by multiple readers.

[]
An IoT Hub message consists of:

* A predetermined set of _system properties_ as listed below.
* A set of _application properties_. A dictionary of string properties that the application can define and access, without needing to deserialize the message body. IoT Hub never modifies these properties.
* An opaque binary body.

[]
* Property name and values can only contain ASCII alphanumeric characters.
* `{'!', '#', '$', '%, '&', ''', '*', '+', '-', '.', '^', '_', '`', '|', '~'}` are also allowed.

[]
Device-to-cloud messaging with IoT Hub has the following characteristics:

* Device-to-cloud messages are durable and retained in an IoT Hub's default messages/events endpoint for up to seven days.
* Device-to-cloud messages can be at most 256 KB, and can be grouped in batches to optimize sends. Batches can be at most 256 KB.
* IoT Hub does not allow arbitrary partitioning. Device-to-cloud messages are partitioned based on their originating *deviceID*.
* IoT Hub enables per-device authentication and access control.
* You can stamp messages with information that goes into the application properties.

[discrete]
=== Message size

'''
IoT Hub measures message size in a protocol-agnostic way, considering only the actual payload.

The size in bytes is calculated as the sum of the following values:

* The body size in bytes.
* The size in bytes of all the values of the message system properties.
* The size in bytes of all user property names and values.

Property names and values are limited to ASCII characters, so the length of the strings equals the size in bytes.

[discrete]
=== Anti-spoofing properties

'''
To avoid device spoofing in device-to-cloud messages, IoT Hub stamps all messages with the following properties:

* iothub-connection-device-id
* iothub-connection-auth-generation-id
* iothub-connection-auth-method

The first two contain the *deviceId* and *generationId* of the originating device (device identity properties).

The iothub-connection-auth-method property contains a json serialized object:-

[source, json]
----
{
  "scope": "{ hub | device }",
  "type": "{ symkey | sas | x509 }",
  "issuer": "iothub"
}
----


== Message Routing

* IoT Hub Message Routing enables users to rout device-to-cloud messages to service-facing endpoints.
* Routing also provides a querying capability to filter the data before routing it to the endpoints.

[discrete]
=== Routing endpoints

'''
* An IoT hub has a default built-in messaging endpoint (messages/events).
* Custom endpoints can be configured that link IoT hub to other services in your subscription.
* IoT Hub currently supports the following custom endpoints:
** Azure Storage containers
** Event Hubs
** Service Bus Queues
** Service Bus Topics

[]
* There are two storage services IoT hub can route messages to: Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
* Both of these use blobs for their storage.
* Service Bus Queues and Service Bus Topics that have Sessions or Duplicate Detection enabled are not supported as custom endpoints.

[discrete]
=== Routing queries

'''
* A single message may match the condition on multiple routing queries.
* The IoT hub delivers the message to the endpoint associated with each matched query.
* IoT hub automatically deduplicates message delivery.
* So if a message matches multiple queries that have the same destination, it is only written once to that destination.
* When you route message data to custom endpoints, messages are only delivered to the built-in endpoint if they do not match any query.
* To deliver messages to both the built-in endpoint and to a custom endpoint, add a route that sends messages to the built-in events endpoint.

[]
* Each routing query you configure has the following properties:

[horizontal]
Name:: The unique name that identifies the query.
Source:: The origin of the data stream to be acted upon. For example, device telemetry.
Condition:: 
  The query expression for the routing query that is run against the following to determine if it is a match for the endpoint:
    * message application properties
    * system properties 
    * message body
    * device twin tags
    * device twin properties
Endpoint::
  * The name of the endpoint where IoT hub sends messages that match the query.
  * We recommend that you choose an endpoint in the same region as your IoT hub.


[discrete]
=== IoT Hub built-in endpoint

'''
* By default, messages are routed to the built-in service-facing endpoint which is compatible with Event Hubs.
* This endpoint is currently only exposed using the AMQP protocol on port 5671 and AMQP over WebSockets on port 443.
* An IoT hub exposes the following properties to enable you to control the built-in endpoint.
+
Partition count:: Set this property at creation to define the number of partitions for device-to-cloud event ingestion.
Retention time:: This property specifies how long in days messages are retained by IoT Hub. The default is one day, but it can be increased to seven days.
* IoT Hub enables you to manage consumer groups on the built-in device-to-cloud receive endpoint.
* You can have up to 20 consumer groups for each IoT Hub.
* If you are using message routing and the fallback route is enabled, all messages that do not match a query on any route go to the built-in endpoint.
* If you disable this fallback route, messages that don't match any query are dropped.
* Retention time can modified programmatically or through the Azure portal.

[discrete]
=== Reading from the Built-in endpoint

'''
* IoT Hub exposes the messages/events built-in endpoint for your back-end services to read the device-to-cloud messages.
* This endpoint is Event Hubs-compatible, which enables you to use any of the mechanisms the Event Hubs service supports for reading messages.
* For services that are aware of IoT Hub, you can use IoT hub service connection string to connect to the built-in endpoint.
* For services that are not aware of IoT Hub, you need an Event Hubs-compatible endpoint and Event Hubs-compatible name.
* You can retrieve these values from IoT hub service in the Azure portal by opening the *Built-in endpoints* blade.
* You can use any shared access policy that has the ServiceConnect permissions to connect to the specified Event Hubs.
* The following Azure products are aware of IoT Hub and you can easily create a service connection to them:
** Azure Functions.
** Azure Stream Analytics.
** Time Series Insights.
** Apache Storm spout.
** Apache Spark integration.
** Azure Databricks.

[discrete]
=== Routing to multiple endpoints

'''
* Message routing can be used for:
** Sending device telemetry messages and events, namely device lifecycle events and device twin change events, to the built-in-endpoint and custom endpoints.
** Filtering data before routing it to various endpoints by applying queries.
** Message routing allows you to query on the message properties and message body as well as device twin tags and device twin properties.

[]
* IoT Hub needs write access to these service endpoints for message routing to work.
* If you configure your endpoints through the Azure portal, the necessary permissions are added for you.
* Make sure you configure your services to support the expected throughput.
* For example, if you are using Event Hubs as a custom endpoint, you must configure the throughput units for that Event Hubs so it handle the ingress of events from IoT Hub.
* Similarly, when using a Service Bus Queue as an endpoint, you must configure the maximum size to ensure the queue can hold all the data ingressed.
* You many need to monitor your endpoints and make any necessary adjustments for the actual load.

[]
* If a message matches multiple routes that point to the same endpoint, IoT Hub delivers the message to that endpoint only once.
* You do not need to configure deduplication on your Service Bus queue or topic.
* In partitioned queues, partition affinity guarantees message ordering.

[discrete]
=== Custom endpoint

'''
* IoT hub supports Azure Storage containers, Event Hubs, Service Bus queues and Service Bus topics as custom endpoint.
** Azure Storage
*** These are two storage services IoT Hub can route messages to -- Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts.
*** Both of these use blobs for their storage.
** Event Hubs
*** Event Hubs is a service that processes large amounts of event data (telemetry) from devices and applications.
*** After you collect data into Event Hubs, you can store the data using a storage cluster or transform it using a real-time analytics provider
** Service Bus Queues and Service Bus Topics
*** Service Bus Queues and Topics must not have Sessions or Duplicate Detection enabled. If either of those options are enabled, the endpoint appears as Unreachable in the Azure portal.

[discrete]
=== Fallback route

'''
* The fallback route sends all the messages that don't satisfy query conditions on any of the existing routes to the built-in endpoint (message/events) that is compatible with Event Hubs.
* If message routing is turned on, you can enable the fallback route capability.
* Once a route is created, data stops flowing to the built-in endpoint, unless a route is created to that endpoint.
* If there are no routes to the built-in-endpoint and a fallback route is enabled, only messages that don't match any query conditions on routes will be sent to the built-in-endpoint.
* Also, if all existing routes are deleted, fallback route must be enabled to receive all data the built-in-endpoint.
* You can enable/disable the fallback route in the Azure portal -> Message Routing blade.
* You can also use Azure Resource Manager for FallbackRouteProperties to use a custom endpoint for fallback route.

[discrete]
=== Non-telemetry events

'''
* In additon to device telemetry, message routing also enables sending device twin change events, device lifecycle events, and digital twin change events.
* For example, if a route is created with data source set to device twin change events, IoT Hub sends messages to the endpoint that contain the change in the device twin.
* Similarly, if a route is created with data source set to device lifecycle events, IoT hub send a message indicating whether the device was deleted or created.

[discrete]
=== Latency

'''
* When you route device-to-cloud telemetry messages using built-in endpoints, there is a slight increase in the end-to-end latency after the creation of the first route. 
* In most cases, the average increase in latency is less than 500ms.
* You can monitor the latency using `Routing: message latency for messages/events` or `d2c.endpoints.latency.builtIn.events` IoT Hub metric.
* Creating or deleting any route after the first one does not impact the end-to-end latency.

[discrete]
=== Monitoring and Troubleshooting

'''
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/monitor-iot-hub[IoT Hub metrics] lists all the metrics that are enabled by default for your IoT Hub.
* The Rest Api https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/iothub/iot-hub-resource/get-endpoint-health?tabs=HTTP[Get Endpoint Health] can be used to get the health status of the endpoints.


== Message Routing Query Syntax

* Message routing allows you to query on the message properties and message body as well as device twin tags and device twin properties.
* If the message body is not JSON, message routing can still route the message, but queries cannot be applied to the message body.
* Queries are boolean expression where a Boolean true makes the query succeed or fail.
* If the expression evaluates to null or undefined, it is treated as false and an error will be generated in diagnostic logs if there is a routing failure.
* The query syntax must be correct for the route to be saved and evaluated.

[discrete]
=== Message properties based routing

'''
* The IoT Hub defines a common format for all device-to-cloud messaging for interoperability across protocols.
* IoT Hub assumes the following JSON representation of the message.
* System properties are added for all users and identify content of the message.
* Users can selectively add appplication properties to the message.
* IoT Hub device-to-cloud messaging is not case-sensitive.
* If you have multiple properties with the same name, IoT Hub will only send one of the properties.

----

[]
* *System properties* help identify contents and source of the messages.
* *Application properties* are user-defined strings that can be added to the message. These fields are optional.

[discrete]
==== Query expressions

'''
* A query on message system properties needs to be prefixed with the `$` symbol.
* Queries on application properties are accessed with their name and should not be prefixed with the `$` symbol.
* If an application property name begins with `$`, then IoT Hub will search for it in the system properties, and if it is not found, then it will look in the application properties.

To query on system property contentEncoding:

[source,sql]
----
$contentEncoding = 'UTF-8'
----

To query on application property processingPath:

[source,sql]
----
processingPath = 'hot'
----

To combine these queries, you can use Boolean expressions and functions:

[source,sql]
----
$contentEncoding = 'UTF-8' AND processingPath = 'hot'
----

[discrete]
=== Message body based routing

* To enable querying on message body, the message should be a JSON encoded in either UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32.
* The `contentType` must be set to `application/JSON` and `contentEncoding` to one of the supported UTF encodings in the system properties.
* If these properties are not specified, IoT Hub will not evaluate the query expression on the message body.

[discrete]
==== Query expressions

* A query on the message body needs to be prefixed with the $body.

Following are all valid query expressions:

[source,sql]
----
$body.Weather.HistoricalData[0].Month = 'Feb'
----

[source,sql]
----
$body.Weather.Temperature = 50 AND $body.Weather.IsEnabled
----

[source,sql]
----
length($body.Weather.Location.State) = 2
----

[source,sql]
----
$body.Weather.Temperature = 50 AND processingPath = 'hot'
----


[discrete]
=== Device Twin based routing

* Message routing enables you to query on Device Twin tags and properties, which are JSON objects.
* Querying on module twin is not supported.
* A sample of Device Twin tags and properties is shown below:

[source, json]
----
{
    "tags": { 
        "deploymentLocation": { 
            "building": "43",

[discrete]
==== Query expressions

'''
* A query on device twin properties needs to be prefixed with the $twin.
* Use unique names in tags and properties as the query is not case-sensitive.

== Message processing options and constraints

[discrete]
=== Message Enrichments

* Message enrichment is the ability of the IoT Hub to stamp messages with additional information before the messages are sent to the designated endpoint.
* One reason to use message enrichments is to include data that can be used to simplify downstream processing.
* For example, enriching device telemetry messages with a device twin tag can reduce load on customers to make device twin API calls for this information.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/consider-message-processing-options-constraints/media/m04-l01-message-enrichments-flow-804be88e.png[]

[]
* A message enrichment has three key elements:
** Enrichment name or key
** A value
** One or more endpoints for which the enrichment should be applied.

[]
* The key is a string.
* A key can only contain alphanumeric characters or these special characters: hyphen(-), underscore (_), and period (.).

The value can be any of the following examples:

* Any static string.
* The name of the IoT hub sending the message. This value is $iothubname.
* Information from the device twin, such as its path. Example would `$twin.tags.field` and `$twin.tags.latitude`.

[NOTE]
====
At this time, only `$iothubname`, `$twin.tags`, `$twin.properties.desired`, and `$twin.properties.reported` are supported variables for message enrichment.
====

[]
* Message enrichments are added as application properties to messages sent to chosen endpoint(s).
* Enrichments are applied per endpoint.
* If you specify five enrichments to be stamped for a specific endpoint, all messages going to that endpoint are stamped with the same five enrichments.

[]
.Limitations
* You can add up to 10 enrichments per IoT Hub. In the case of the free tier, only 2 enrichments are allowed.
* If you are applying an enrichment with a value set to a tag or property in the device twin, the value will be stamped as a string value.
* For example, if an enrichment value is set to `$twin.tags.field`, the messages will be stamped with the string "`$twin.tags.field`" rather than the value of that field from the twin.
* This happens in the following cases:
** Your IoT Hub is in the basic tier. Basic tier IoT hubs do not support device twins.
** Your IoT Hub is in the Standard tier, but the device sending the message has no device twin.
** Your IoT Hub is in the standared tier, but the device twin path used for the value of the enrichment does not exist.
*** For example, if the enrichment value is set to `$twin.tags.location`, and the device twin does not have a `location` property under `tags`, the message is stamped with the string `$twin.tags.location`.
* Updates to a device twin can take up to five minutes to be reflected in the corresponding enrichment value.
* The total message size, including the enrichments, can't exceed 256KB.
** If the message size exceeds 256 KB, the IoT Hub will drop the message.
** You can use IoT Hub metrics to identify and debug errors when messages are dropped. For example, you can monitor `d2d.telemetry.egress.invalid`.
* Message enrichments don't apply to digital twin change events.

[]
.Pricing
* Message enrichments are available at no extra charge.
* Currently, you are charged when you send a message to an IoT hub.
* You are only charged once for that message, even if the message goes to multiple endpoints.


== IoT Hub quotas and throttling

* Each Azure subscription can have at most 50 IoT hubs, and at most one Free hub.
* Each IoT hub is provisioned with one or more units in a specific tier.
* The tier and number of units determine the maximum daily quota of messages that you send
* The message size used to calculate the daily quota is 0.5 KB for a free tier hub and 4 KB for all other tiers.
* The tier also determines the throttling limits that IoT Hub enforces on all operations.

.Operation throttles
* Operation throttles are rate limitations that are applied in minute ranges and are intended to prevent abuse.
* They are also subject to traffic shaping.

== Azure IoT Edge

* Azure IoT Edge enables you to scale out your IoT solution by packaging your business logic into standard containers.
* You can deploy these containers to any of your devices and monitor it all from the cloud.
* If you want to respond to emergencies as quickly as possible, you can run anomaly detection workloads at the edge.
* If you want to reduce bandwidth costs and avoid transferring terabytes of raw data, you can clean and aggregate the data locally then only send the insights to the cloud for analysis.

Azure IoT Edge is made up of three components:
* *IoT Edge modules* are containers that run Azure services, third-party services, or your own code. Modules are deployed to IoT Edge devices and execute locally on those devices.
* The *IoT Edge runtime* runs on each IoT Edge device and manages the modules deployed to each device.
* A *cloud-based interface* enables you to remotely monitor and manage IoT Edge devices.

[]
.IoT Edge modules
* IoT Edge modules are units of execution, implemented as Docker compatible containers, that run your business logic at the edge.
* You can develop custom modules or package certain Azure services into modules that provide insights offline and at the edge.

[]
.Azure services at the edge
* Azure IoT Edge allows you to deploy and execute complex azure services like Functions, Stream Analytics and Machine Learning on-premises.

[]
.Bring your own code
* You can deploy you own code to your Azure IoT Edge devices.
* You can run the same code on a device or in the cloud.
* Azure IoT Edge supports both Linux and Windows so you can code to the platform of your choice.
* It supports Java, dotnet-core, node.js, C, and Python.

[]
.IoT Edge runtime
* The Azure IoT Edge runtime sits on the IoT Edge device, and performs management and communication operations
* It supports both Linux and Windows operating systems and abstracts hardware details.
* Use a device smaller than a Raspberry Pi 3 if you are not processing much data, or use an industrial server to run resource-intensive workloads.

[]
.IoT Edge Cloud Interface
* It is difficult to manage millions of devices of different makes and models and geographically scattered.
* Workloads are created and configured for a particular type of device, deployed to all of your devices, and monitored to catch any misbehaving devices.
* These activities cannot be done on a per device basis and must be done at scale.
* Cloud services allow you to:
** Create and configure a workload to be run on a specific type of device.
** Send a workload to a set of devices.
** Monitor workloads running on devices in the field.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/media/m06-l01-cloud-interface-27b30369.png[]

== IoT Edge Runtime

* The IoT Edge runtime is a collection of programs that turn a device into an IoT Edge device.
* The IoT Edge runtime components enable IoT Edge devices to receive code to run at the edge and communicate the results.
* The *IoT Edge Hub* module of the runtime is responsible for communication.
* The *IoT Edge Agent* module deploys and monitors the modules.
* The IoT Edge Hub and the IoT Edge Agent modules are referred to as the runtime modules.

.IoT Edge Hub
* The IoT Edge hub acts as a local proxy for IoT Hub by exposing the same protocol endpoints as IoT Hub.
* This consistency means that clients can connect to the IoT Edge runtime just as they would to IoT Hub.
* IoT Edge hub supports clients that connect using MQTT or AMQP. It does not support clients that use HTTP.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/media/m06-l01-iot-edge-hub-682ff0e6.png[]

.Module Communication
* IoT Edge hub facilitates module to module communication
* Using IoT Edge hub as a message broker keeps modules independent from each other.
* Modules only need to specify the inputs on which they accept messages and the outputs to which they write messages.
* A solution developer can stitch these inputs and outputs together so that the modules process data in the order specific to that solution.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/media/m06-l01-iot-edge-module-communication-module-endpoints-a729b3b0.png[]

[]
* To send data to the IoT Edge hub, a module calls the SendEventAsync method.
* The first argument specifies on which output to send the message.
* The following pseudocode sends a message on output1:

[source, csharp]
----
ModuleClient client = await ModuleClient.CreateFromEnvironmentAsync(transportSettings);
await client.OpenAsync();
await client.SendEventAsync("output1", message);
----

[]
* To receive a message, register a callback that processes messages coming in on a specific input.
* The following pseudocode registers the function messageProcessor to be used for processing all messages received on input1:

[source, csharp]
----
await client.SetInputMessageHandlerAsync("input1", messageProcessor, userContext);
----

[]
* The solution developer is responsible for specifying the rules that determine how IoT Edge passes messages between modules.
* Routing rules are defined in the cloud and pushed down to IoT Edge hub in its module twin.


== IoT Edge Agent
* The IoT Edge agent is the other module that makes up the Azure IoT Edge runtime.
* It is responsible for instantiating modules, ensuring that they continue to run, and reporting the status of the modules back to IoT Hub.
* This configuration data is written as a property of the IoT Edge agent module twin.

.Deployment manifest
* The IoT Edge security daemon starts the IoT Edge agent on device startup.
* The agent retrieves its module twin from IoT Hub and inspects the deployment manifest.
* The deployment manifest is a JSON file that declares the modules that need to be started.
* Some interesting properties are:
** *settings.image** - The container image that the IoT Edge agent uses to start the module.
** *settings.createOptions* - A string passed directly to the Moby container daemon when starting a module's container. Adding options in this property allows for advanced configurations like port forwarding or mounting volumes into a module's container.
** *status* - The state in which the IoT Edge agent places the module. The IoT Edge agent reports the status of each module back to the cloud in the reported properties. A difference between the desired property and the reported property is an indicator of a misbehaving device. The supported statuses are:
*** Downloading
*** Running
*** Unhealthy
*** Failed
*** Stopped
** *restartPolicy* - How the IoT Edge agent restarts a module. Possible values include:
*** Never - The IoT Edge agent nevers restarts the module.
*** On-failure - If the module crashes, the IoT Edge agent restarts it. If the module shuts down cleanly, the IoT Edge agent does not restart it.
*** On-unhealthy - If the module crashes or is considered unhealthy, the IoT Edge agent restarts it.
*** Always - If the module crashes, is considered unhealthy, or shuts down in any way, the IoT Edge agent restarts it.
** *imagePullPolicy** - Whether the IoT Edge agents attempts to pull the latest image for a module automatically or not. If you do not specify a value, the default is onCreate. Possible values includ:
*** On-create - When starting a module or updating a module, the IoT Edge agent will attempt to pull the module image from the container registry.
*** Never - The expectation is that the module image is cached on the device, and any module image updates are made manually or managed by a third party solution.

.Command-line tool
* The iotedge tool is a command-line tool that is used to manage the IoT Edge runtime.
* To view the available subcommands:

[source, bash]
----
iotedge help
----


The *iotedge* command-line tool provides a number of commands to assist in the management of IoT Edge modules that are deployed to the device.

* To obtain a list of deployed modules

[source, bash]
----
sudo iotedge list
----

* To restart a specific module,

[source,bash]
----
sudo iotedge restart module-name
----

* To vies diagnostic logs related to a specific module,

[source, bash]
----
sudo iotedge logs module-name
----

The *iotedge* tool is useful for troubleshooting configuration issues and performs a series of checks.

* To view a list of the available checks,

[source, bash]
----
iotedge check-list
----

* To execute the full list of checks, the *iotedge* tool must be run with elevated privileges:

[source, bash]
----
sudo iotedge check
----

== Azure IoT Edge modules

To understand how modules are developed, deployed, and maintained, it helps to think of the four conceptual elements of a module:

* A module image is a package containing the software that defines a module.
* A module instance is the specific unit of computation running the module image on an IoT Edge device. The module instance is started by the IoT Edge runtime.
* A module identity is a piece of informatio stored in IoT Hub, that is associated to each module instance.
* A module twin is a JSON document stored in IoT Hub, that contains state information for a module instance, including metadata, configurations, and conditions.

.Module images and instances
* IoT Edge module images contain applications that take advantage of the management, security, and communication features of the IoT Edge runtime.
* You can develop your own module images, or export one from a supported Azure service.
* The images exist in the cloud and they can be updated, changed, and deployed in different solutions.
* Each time a module image is deployed to a device and started by the IoT Edge runtime, a new instance of that module is created.
* Module images exist as container images in a repository, and module instances are containers on devices.

.Module identities
* When a new module instance is created by the IoT Edge runtime, the instance is associated with a corresponding module identity.
* The module identity is stored in the IoT Hub.
* It is used as the addressing and security scope for all local and cloud communications for that specific module instance.
* The identity associated with a module instance depends on the identity of the device on which the instance is running and the name you provide to that module in your solution.
* For example, if you deploy a module to a device called `Hannover01`, the IoT Edge runtime creates a corresponding module identity called `/devices/Hannover01/modules/insight`.

.Module Twins
* Each module instance also has a corresponding module twin that you can use to configure the module instance. 
* The instance and the twin are associated with each other through the module identity.
* A module twin is a JSON document that stores module information and configuration properties.
* The structure of a module twin is the same as a device twin.

[source, csharp]
----
// Create a ModuleClient object. This ModuleClient will act on behalf of a
// module since it is created with a module's connection string instead
// of a device connection string.
ModuleClient client = new ModuleClient.CreateFromEnvironmentAsync(settings);
await client.OpenAsync();

// Get the module twin
Twin twin = await client.GetTwinAsync();
----

.Offline Capabilities
* Azure IoT Edge modules can operate offline indefinitely after syncing with IoT Hub at least once.
* IoT Edge devices can also extend this offline capability to other IoT devices.


== Module Twin Properties

* The module twins for the IoT Edge hub and IoT Edge agent modules provide properties that can be used to manage module communication and lifecycle.
* Each module twin includes:
** *Desired properties.* - The solution backend can set desired properties, and the module can read them. The module can also receive notifications of changes in the desired properties. Desired properties are used along with reported properties to synchronize module configuration or conditions.
** *Reported properties.* - The module can set reported properties, and the solution backend can read and query them. Reported properties are used along with desired properties to synchronize module configuration or conditions.

.Edge Agent desired properties

* The module twin for the IoT Edge agent is called $edgeAgent and coordinates the communications between the IoT Edge agent running on a device and IoT Hub. 
* The desired properties are set when applying a deployment manifest on a specific device as part of a single-device or at-scale deployment.
* You can find a list of properties and what they do at this location: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/5-module-twin-properties-of-edge-runtime-modules

.Edge Agent Reported Properties

* The IoT Edge agent reported properties include three main pieces of information:
** The status of the application of the last-seen desired properties;
** The status of the modules currently running on the device, as reported by the IoT Edge agent; and
** A copy of the desired properties currently running on the device.
* This last piece of information, a copy of the current desired properties, is useful to tell whether the device has applied the latest desired properties or is still running a previous deployment manifest.
* You can find a list of properties and what they do at this location: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/5-module-twin-properties-of-edge-runtime-modules

.EdgeHub desired properties
* The module twin for the IoT Edge hub is called `$edgeHub`` and coordinates the communications between the IoT Edge hub running on a device and IoT Hub.
* The desired properties are set when applying a deployment manifest on a specific device as part of a single-device or at-scale deployment.
* You can find a list of properties and what they do at this location: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/5-module-twin-properties-of-edge-runtime-modules

== IoT Edge Security Manager

* The Azure IoT Edge security manager is a well-bounded security core for protecting the IoT Edge device and all its components by abstracting the secure silicon hardware.
* It is the focal point for security hardening and provides technology integration point to original equipment manufacturers (OEM).

.Microsoft Learn
image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/media/m06-l01-iot-edge-iot-edge-security-manager-45164d81.png[]


The responsibilities of the IoT Edge security manager include, but aren't limited to:
* Secured and measured bootstrapping of the Azure IoT Edge device.
* Device identity provisioning and transition of trust where applicable.
* Host and protect device components of cloud services like Device Provisioning Service.
* Securely provision IoT Edge modules with unique identities.
* Gatekeeper to device hardware root of trust through notary services.
* Monitor the integrity of IoT Edge operations at runtime.

IoT Edge security manager includes three components:
* IoT Edge security daemon.
* Hardware security module platform abstraction Layer (HSM PAL).
* Optional but highly recommended hardware silicon root of trust or HSM.
 
[discrete]
=== IoT Edge security daemon 
* The IoT Edge security daemon is responsible for the logical operations of IoT Edge security manager.
* The IoT Edge security daemon follows two core principles: maximize operational integrity, and minimize bloat and churn.

[discrete]
==== Maximize operational integrity
* Physical access is always a threat to IoT devices.
* Hardware root of trust plays an important role in defending the integrity of the IoT Edge security daemon.
* Hardware root of trust come in two varieties:
** Secure elements for the protection of sensitive information like secrets and cryptographic keys.
** Secure enclaves for the protection of secrets like keys, and sensitive workloads like metering and billing.

Two kinds of execution environments exist to use hardware root of trust:
* The standard or rich execution environment (REE) that relies on the use of secure elements to protect sensitive information.
* The trusted execution environment (TEE) that relies on the use of secure enclave technology to protect sensitive information and offer protection to software execution.

For devices using secure enclaves as hardware root of trust, sensitive logic within IoT Edge security daemon should be inside the enclave.

Non-sensitive portions of the security daemon can be outside of the TEE.

[discrete]
==== Minimize bloat and churn
* For the highest level of trust, the IoT Edge security daemon can tightly couple with the device hardware root of trust and operate as native code.


[discrete]
=== Architecture of IoT Edge security daemon

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/media/m06-l01-iot-edge-iot-edge-security-daemon-37de8171.png[]

* The IoT Edge security daemon takes advantage of any available hardware root of trust technology for security hardening.
* It also allows for split-world operation between a standard/rich execution environment (REE) and a trusted execution environment (TEE) when hardware technologies offer trusted execution environments.
* Role-specific interfaces enable the major components of IoT Edge to assure the integrity of the IoT Edge device and its operations

[discrete]
=== Cloud Interface
* The cloud interface allows the IoT Edge security daemon to access cloud services such as cloud compliments to device security like security renewal.
*  For example, the IoT Edge security daemon currently uses this interface to access the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service for device identity lifecycle management.

[discrete]
=== Management API
* IoT Edge security daemon offers a management API, which is called by the IoT Edge agent when creating/starting/stopping/removing an IoT Edge module.
* The security daemon stores “registrations” for all active modules.
* These registrations map a module’s identity to some properties of the module.
* A few examples for these properties are the process identifier (pid) of the process running in the container or the hash of the docker container’s contents.
* These properties are used by the workload API to verify that the caller is authorized to perform an action.
* The management API is a privileged API, callable only from the IoT Edge agent.
* Since the IoT Edge security daemon bootstraps and starts the IoT Edge agent, it can create an implicit registration for the IoT Edge agent, after it has attested that the IoT Edge agent has not been tampered with.
* The same attestation process that the workload API uses also restricts access to the management API to only the IoT Edge agent.

[discrete]
=== Container API
* The container API interacts with the container system in use for module management, like Moby or Docker.

[discrete]
=== Workload API
* The workload API is accessible to all modules.
* It provides proof of identity, either as an HSM rooted signed token or an X509 certificate, and the corresponding trust bundle to a module.
* The trust bundle contains CA certificates for all the other servers that the modules should trust.
* The IoT Edge security daemon uses an attestation process to guard this API.
* When a module calls this API, the security daemon attempts to find a registration for the identity.
* If successful, it uses the properties of the registration to measure the module.
* If the result of the measurement process matches the registration, a new proof of identity is generated.
* The corresponding CA certificates (trust bundle) are returned to the module.
* The module uses this certificate to connect to IoT Hub, other modules, or start a server.
* When the signed token or certificate nears expiration, it's the responsibility of the module to request a new certificate.

[discrete]
=== Integration and maintenance
Microsoft maintains the main code base for the IoT Edge security daemon on GitHub.

[discrete]
==== Installation and updates
* Installation and updates of the IoT Edge security daemon are managed through the operating system's package management system.
* IoT Edge devices with hardware root of trust should provide extra hardening to the integrity of the daemon by managing its lifecycle through the secure boot and updates management systems.

[discrete]
==== Versioning
* The IoT Edge runtime tracks and reports the version of the IoT Edge security daemon.
* The version is reported as the runtime.platform.version attribute of the IoT Edge agent module reported property.

[discrete]
=== Hardware security module platform abstraction layer (HSM PAL)
* The HSM PAL abstracts all root of trust hardware to isolate the developer or user of IoT Edge from their complexities.
* It includes a combination of application programming interface (API) and trans-domain communication procedures, for example communication between a standard execution environment and a secure enclave.
* The actual implementation of the HSM PAL depends on the specific secure hardware in use.
* Its existence enables the use of virtually any secure silicon hardware.

[discrete]
=== Secure silicon root of trust hardware
* Secure silicon is necessary to anchor trust inside the IoT Edge device hardware.
* Secure silicon come in variety to include Trusted Platform Module (TPM), embedded Secure Element (eSE), Arm TrustZone, Intel SGX, and custom secure silicon technologies.
* The use of secure silicon root of trust in devices is recommended given the threats associated with physical accessibility of IoT devices.

[discrete]
=== IoT Edge security manager integration and maintenance
* The IoT Edge security manager aims to identify and isolate the components that defend the security and integrity of the Azure IoT Edge platform for custom hardening.
* Third parties, like device makers, should make use of custom security features available with their device hardware.

== IoT Edge certificates and module identity
* To establish a secure TLS connection, the IoT Edge hub module presents a server certificate chain to connecting clients in order for them to verify its identity.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The IoT Edge certificates discussed in this topic and the Azure IoT Hub certificates that the hub uses to authenticate devices are two different things.
* This topic discusses the certificates that are used to secure connections between the different components on an IoT Edge device or between an IoT Edge device and any leaf devices.
* You may also use certificates to authenticate your IoT Edge device to IoT Hub.
* Those authentication certificates are different
====

[discrete]
=== IoT Edge certificates
* There are two common scenarios for setting up certificates on an IoT Edge device.
** Sometimes the end user, or operator, of a device purchases a generic device made by a manufacturer then manages the certificates themselves.
** Other times, the manufacturer works under contract to build a custom device for the operator and does some initial certificate signing before handing off the device.
** The IoT Edge certificate design attempts to take both scenarios into account.
*  There may be zero, one, or many intermediate signing certificates between the root CA certificate and the device CA certificate, depending on the number of entities involved. 

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/media/m06-l01-iot-edge-edge-certs-general-july2022-a0d39603.png[]

[discrete]
=== Certificate authority
* The certificate authority, or 'CA' for short, is an entity that issues digital certificates.
* A certificate authority acts as a trusted third party between the owner, and the receiver of the certificate.
* A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the receiver of the certificate.
* The certificate chain of trust works by initially issuing a root certificate, which is the basis for trust in all certificates issued by the authority.
* Afterwards, the owner can use the root certificate to issue more intermediate certificates ('leaf' certificates).

[discrete]
=== Root CA certificate
* A root CA certificate is the root of trust of the entire process.
* In production scenarios, this CA certificate can be purchased from a trusted commercial certificate authority like Baltimore, Verisign, or DigiCert.
* Should you have complete control over the devices connecting to your IoT Edge devices, it's possible to use a corporate level certificate authority.
* In either event, the entire certificate chain from the IoT Edge hub up rolls up to it, so the leaf IoT devices must trust the root certificate.
* You can store the root CA certificate either in the trusted root certificate authority store, or provide the certificate details in your application code.

[discrete]
=== Intermediate certificates
* In a typical manufacturing process for creating secure devices, root CA certificates are rarely used directly, primarily because of the risk of leakage or exposure.
* The root CA certificate creates and digitally signs one or more intermediate CA certificates.
* There may only be one, or there may be a chain of these intermediate certificates.
* Scenarios that would require a chain of intermediate certificates include:
** A hierarchy of departments within a manufacturer.
** Multiple companies involved serially in the production of a device.
** A customer buying a root CA and deriving a signing certificate for the manufacturer to sign the devices they make on that customer's behalf.
* In any case, the manufacturer uses an intermediate CA certificate at the end of this chain to sign the device CA certificate placed on the end device.
* Generally, these intermediate certificates are closely guarded at the manufacturing plant. They undergo strict processes, both physical and electronic for their usage.

[discrete]
=== Edge CA certificate
* The edge (device) CA certificate is generated from and signed by the final intermediate CA certificate in the process.
* This certificate is installed on the IoT Edge device itself, preferably in secure storage such as a hardware security module (HSM). 
* In addition, an edge CA certificate uniquely identifies an IoT Edge device. 
* The edge CA certificate can sign other certificates.

[discrete]
=== IoT Edge hub server certificate
* The IoT Edge hub server certificate is the actual certificate presented to leaf devices and modules for identity verification during establishment of the TLS connection required by IoT Edge.
* This certificate presents the full chain of signing certificates used to generate it up to the root CA certificate, which the leaf IoT device must trust.
* When generated by IoT Edge, the common name (CN), of this IoT Edge hub certificate is set to the 'hostname' property in the config file after conversion to lower case.

[discrete]
=== Production Implications
* A reasonable question might be "why does IoT Edge need the 'workload CA' extra certificate?
* Couldn't it use the device CA certificate to directly generate the IoT Edge hub server certificate?".
* Technically, it could. However, the purpose of this "workload" intermediate certificate is to separate concerns between the device manufacturer and the device operator.
* Imagine a scenario where an IoT Edge device is sold or transferred from one customer to another.
* You would likely want the device CA certificate provided by the manufacturer to be immutable.
* However, the "workload" certificates specific to operation of the device should be wiped and recreated for the new deployment.
* Because manufacturing and operation processes are separated, consider the following implications when preparing production devices:
** With any certificate-based process, the root CA certificate and all intermediate CA certificates should be secured and monitored during the entire process of rolling out an IoT Edge device.
** The IoT Edge device manufacturer should have strong processes in place for proper storage and usage of their intermediate certificates.
** In addition, the device CA certificate should be kept in as secure storage as possible on the device itself, preferably a hardware security module.
** The IoT Edge hub server certificate is presented by IoT Edge hub to the connecting client devices and modules.
** The common name (CN) of the device CA certificate must not be the same as the "hostname" that will be used in the config file on the IoT Edge device.
** The name used by clients to connect to IoT Edge (for example, via the GatewayHostName parameter of the connection string or the CONNECT command in MQTT) can't be the same as the common name used in the device CA certificate.
** This restriction is because the IoT Edge hub presents its entire certificate chain for verification by clients.
** If the IoT Edge hub server certificate and the device CA certificate both have the same CN, you get in a verification loop and the certificate invalidates.
** Because the device CA certificate is used by the IoT Edge security daemon to generate the final IoT Edge certificates, it must itself be a signing certificate, meaning it has certificate signing capabilities.
** Applying "V3 Basic constraints CA:True" to the device CA certificate automatically sets up the required key usage properties.

[discrete]
=== Dev/Test implications
* To ease development and test scenarios, Microsoft provides a set of convenience scripts for generating non-production certificates suitable for IoT Edge in the transparent gateway scenario.
* The following commands generate the "root CA certificate" and a single "intermediate CA certificate":

[source,bash]
----
./certGen.sh create_root_and_intermediate
----

[source,console]
----
New-CACertsCertChain rsa
----

Likewise, these commands generate the "Device CA Certificate".

[source,bash]
----
./certGen.sh create_edge_device_ca_certificate "<gateway device name>"
----

[source,console]
----
New-CACertsEdgeDeviceCA "<gateway device name>"
----

[discrete]
=== Example of IoT Edge certificate hierarchy
* To illustrate an example of this certificate path, the following screenshot is from a working IoT Edge device set up as a transparent gateway.
* OpenSSL is used to connect to the IoT Edge hub, validate, and dump out the certificates.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-azure-iot-edge-environment/media/m06-l01-iot-edge-iot-edge-cert-chain-july2022-854acc7a.png[]

You can see the hierarchy of certificate depth represented in the screenshot:

.Heirarchy
[cols="1,1"]
|===

|Root CA Certificate
|Azure IoT Hub CA Cert Test Only

|Intermediate CA Certificate
|Azure IoT Hub intermediate certification test only.

|Edge CA Certificate
| `iotgateway.ca` ("iotgateway" was passed in as the < gateway host name > to the convenience scripts).

|IoT Edge Hub Server Certificate
|`iotedgegw.local` (matches the 'hostname' from config.yaml).

|===

== IoT Edge Deployment Concepts

Azure IoT Edge devices follow a device lifecycle that is similar to other types of IoT devices:

. Provision new IoT Edge devices by imaging a device with an OS and installing the IoT Edge runtime.
. Configure the devices to run IoT Edge modules, and then monitor their health.
. Finally, retire devices when they are replaced or become obsolete.

Azure IoT Edge provides two ways to configure the modules to run on IoT Edge devices:

* One for development and fast iterations on a single device.
* One for managing large fleets of IoT Edge devices.

Both approaches can be implemented either programmatically or by using the Azure portal.

We use the term *IoT Edge automatic deployments* to refer to configuration and monitoring stages for fleets of devices.

When targeting groups or a large number of devices, you can use tags in the device twins to specify which devices you'd like your modules deployed to.

At a high level, IoT Edge automatic deployments include the following steps:

. An operator defines a deployment that describes a set of modules and the target devices. Each deployment has a deployment manifest that reflects this information.
. The IoT Hub service communicates with all targeted devices to configure them with the desired modules.
. The IoT Hub service retrieves status from the IoT Edge devices and makes them available to the operator. For example, an operator can see when an IoT Edge device is not configured successfully or if a module fails during runtime.
. At any time, new IoT Edge devices that meet the targeting conditions are configured for the deployment. For example, a deployment that targets all IoT Edge devices in Washington State automatically configures a new IoT Edge device once it is provisioned and added to the Washington State device group.

[discrete]
=== Deployment
An IoT Edge automatic deployment works by configuring an IoT Edge deployment manifest to include a list of modules with the corresponding initialization parameters.

Once an IoT Edge device receives a deployment manifest, it downloads and installs the container images from the respective container repositories, and configures them accordingly.

Once a deployment is created, an operator can monitor the deployment status to see whether targeted devices are correctly configured.

Only IoT Edge devices can be configured with a deployment. The following prerequisites must be on the device before it can receive the deployment:

* The base operating system.
* A container management system, like Moby or Docker.
* Provisioning of the IoT Edge runtime.

[discrete]
==== Deployment manifest
A deployment manifest is a JSON document that describes the modules to be configured on the targeted IoT Edge devices.

It contains the configuration metadata for all the modules, including the required system modules.

The configuration metadata for each module includes:

* Version.
* Type.
* Status (for example, running or stopped).
* Restart policy.
* Image and container registry.
* Routes for data input and output.

If the module image is stored in a private container registry, the IoT Edge agent holds the registry credentials.

[discrete]
==== Target condition
The target condition is continuously evaluated throughout the lifetime of the deployment. 

Any new devices that meet the requirements are included, and any existing devices that no longer do are removed.

The deployment is reactivated if the service detects any target condition change.

Use any Boolean condition on device twins tags or deviceId to select the target devices.

If you want to use condition with tags, you need to add "tags":{} section in the device twin under the same level as properties.

Target condition examples:
 
* deviceId ='linuxprod1'
* tags.environment ='prod'
* tags.environment = 'prod' AND tags.location = 'westus'
* tags.environment = 'prod' OR tags.location = 'westus'
* tags.operator = 'John' AND tags.environment = 'prod' AND NOT deviceId = 'linuxprod1'
* properties.reported.devicemodel = '4000x'

Here are some constraints when you construct a target condition:

* In device twin, you can only build a target condition using tags, reported properties, or deviceId.
* Double quotes aren't allowed in any portion of the target condition. Use single quotes.
* Single quotes represent the values of the target condition. Therefore, you must escape the single quote with another single quote if it's part of the device name. For example, to target a device called "operator's Device", write deviceId='operator''sDevice'.
* Numbers, letters, and the following characters are allowed in target condition values: `-:.+%_#*?!(),=@;$`.

[discrete]
==== Priority
A priority defines whether a deployment should be applied to a targeted device relative to other deployments.

A deployment priority is a positive integer, with larger numbers denoting higher priority.

If an IoT Edge device is targeted by more than one deployment, the deployment with the highest priority applies.

Deployments with lower priorities are not applied, nor are they merged.

If a device is targeted with two or more deployments with equal priority, the most recently created deployment (determined by the creation timestamp) applies.

[discrete]
==== Labels
Labels are string key/value pairs that you can use to filter and group deployments.

A deployment may have multiple labels.

Labels are optional and do no impact the actual configuration of IoT Edge devices.

[discrete]
==== Metrics
By default, all deployments report on four metrics:

* *Targeted* shows the IoT Edge devices that match the Deployment targeting condition.
* *Applied* shows the targeted IoT Edge devices that are not targeted by another deployment of higher priority.
* *Reporting Success* shows the IoT Edge devices that have reported that the modules have been deployed successfully.
* *Reporting Failure* shows the IoT Edge devices that have reported that one or more modules haven't been deployed successfully. To further investigate the error, connect remotely to those devices and view the log files.

You can define your own custom metrics to help monitor and manage the deployment.

Metrics provide summary counts of the various states that devices may report back as a result of applying a deployment configuration.

Metrics can query edgeHub module twin reported properties, like lastDesiredStatus or lastConnectTime.

[discrete]
=== Phased rollout
A phased rollout is an overall process whereby an operator deploys changes to a broadening set of IoT Edge devices.

The goal is to make changes gradually to reduce the risk of making wide scale breaking changes.

A phased rollout is executed in the following phases and steps:

. Establish a test environment of IoT Edge devices by provisioning them and setting a device twin tag like `tag.environment='test'`. The test environment should mirror the production environment that the deployment will eventually target.
. Create a deployment including the desired modules and configurations. The targeting condition should target the test IoT Edge device environment.
. Validate the new module configuration in the test environment.
. Update the deployment to include a subset of production IoT Edge devices by adding a new tag to the targeting condition. Also, ensure that the priority for the deployment is higher than other deployments currently targeted to those devices.
. Verify that the deployment succeeded on the targeted IoT Devices by viewing the deployment status.
. Update the deployment to target all remaining production IoT Edge devices.

[discrete]
=== Layered deployment
Layered deployments are automatic deployments that can be combined together to reduce the number of unique deployments that need to be created.

Layered deployments are useful in scenarios where the same modules are reused in different combinations in many automatic deployments.

Layered deployments target devices based on tags in the device twins.

Layered deployments also have priorities assigned to them, but instead of using the priority to determine which deployment is applied to a device, the priority determines how multiple deployments are ranked on a device.

For example, if two layered deployments have a module or a route with the same name, the layered deployment with the higher priority will be applied while the lower priority is overwritten.

The system runtime modules, edgeAgent and edgeHub, are not configured as part of a layered deployment.

Any IoT Edge device targeted by a layered deployment needs a standard automatic deployment applied to it first.

The automatic deployment provides the base upon which layered deployments can be added.

An IoT Edge device can apply one and only one standard automatic deployment, but it can apply multiple layered automatic deployments.

Any layered deployments targeting a device must have a higher priority than the automatic deployment for that device.

For example, consider the following scenario of a company that manages buildings.

With standard automatic deployments, the company needs to create individual deployments for all the module combinations that their buildings need.

image:: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-iot-edge-device-deployment/media/m06-l03-layered-deployment-1-a39f9bda.png[]

However, once the company switches to layered automatic deployments they find that they can create the same module combinations for their buildings with fewer deployments to manage. Each module has its own layered deployment, and the device tags identify which modules get added to each building.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-iot-edge-device-deployment/media/m06-l03-layered-deployment-2-06d76fe9.png[]

[discrete]
=== Rollback
Deployments can be rolled back if you receive errors or misconfigurations.

Deleting a deployment doesn't remove the modules from targeted devices.

There must be another deployment that defines a new configuration for the devices, even if it's an empty deployment.

Perform rollbacks in the following sequence:

. Confirm that a second deployment is also targeted at the same device set. If the goal of the rollback is to remove all modules, the second deployment should not include any modules.
. Modify or remove the target condition expression of the deployment you wish to roll back so that the devices no longer meet the targeting condition.
. Verify that the rollback succeeded by viewing the deployment status.
  * The rolled-back deployment should no longer show status for the devices that were rolled back.
  * The second deployment should now include deployment status for the devices that were rolled back.


== IoT Edge deployment manifest

The deployment manifest tells your device which modules to install and how to configure them to work together.

The deployment manifest is a JSON document that describes:

* The IoT Edge agent module twin, which includes three components.
** The container image for each module that runs on the device.
** The credentials to access private container registries that contain module images.
** Instructions for how each module should be created and managed.
* The IoT Edge hub module twin, which includes how messages flow between modules and eventually to IoT Hub.
* Optionally, the desired properties of any other module twins.

All IoT Edge devices must be configured with a deployment manifest. 

A newly installed IoT Edge runtime reports an error code until configured with a valid manifest. 

You can create a deployment manifest using the Azure IoT Edge portal, REST APIs, or the IoT Hub Service SDK.

[discrete]
=== Create a deployment manifest
At a high level, a deployment manifest is a list of module twins that are configured with their desired properties.

A deployment manifest tells an IoT Edge device (or a group of devices) which modules to install and how to configure them.

Deployment manifests include the desired properties for each module twin.

IoT Edge devices report back the reported properties for each module.

Two modules are required in every deployment manifest: `$edgeAgent`, and `$edgeHub`. 

These modules are part of the IoT Edge runtime that manages the IoT Edge device and the modules running on it.

In addition to the two runtime modules, you can add up to 50 modules of your own to run on an IoT Edge device.

A deployment manifest that contains only the IoT Edge runtime (edgeAgent and edgeHub) is valid.

Deployment manifests follow this structure:

[source,json]
----
{
    "modulesContent": {
        "$edgeAgent": { // required
            "properties.desired": {
                // desired properties of the Edge agent
                // includes the image URIs of all modules
                // includes container registry credentials
            }
        },
        "$edgeHub": { //required
            "properties.desired": {
                // desired properties of the Edge hub
                // includes the routing information between modules, and to IoT Hub
            }
        },
        "module1": {  // optional
            "properties.desired": {
                // desired properties of module1
            }
        },
        "module2": {  // optional
            "properties.desired": {
                // desired properties of module2
            }
        }
    }
}
----

[discrete]
=== Configure modules
The IoT Edge agent is the runtime component that manages installation, updates, and status reporting for an IoT Edge device.

Therefore, the `$edgeAgent` module twin requires the configuration and management information for all modules.

For a complete list of properties that can or must be included, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/module-edgeagent-edgehub?view=iotedge-1.4[Properties of the IoT Edge agent and IoT Edge hub module twins].

The `$edgeAgent` properties follow this structure:

[source,json]
----
"$edgeAgent": {
    "properties.desired": {
        "schemaVersion": "1.1",
        "runtime": {
            "settings":{
                "registryCredentials":{
                      // give the edge agent access to
                      // container images that aren't public
                }
            }
        },
        "systemModules": {
            "edgeAgent": {
                // configuration and management details
            },
            "edgeHub": {
                // configuration and management details
            }
        },
        "modules": {
            "module1": { // optional
                // configuration and management details
            },
            "module2": { // optional
                // configuration and management details
            }
        }
    }
},
----

[discrete]
=== Declare routes
The IoT Edge hub manages communication between modules, IoT Hub, and any leaf devices.

Therefore, the `$edgeHub` module twin contains a desired property called routes that declares how messages are passed within a deployment.

You can have multiple routes within the same deployment.

Routes are declared in the `$edgeHub` desired properties with the following syntax:

[source,json]
----
"$edgeHub": {
    "properties.desired": {
        "routes": {
            "route1": "FROM <source> WHERE <condition> INTO <sink>",
            "route2": "FROM <source> WHERE <condition> INTO <sink>"
        },
    }
}
----

Every route needs a source and a sink, but the condition is an optional piece that you can use to filter messages.

[discrete]
==== Source
The source specifies where the messages come from.

IoT Edge can route messages from modules or leaf devices.

Using the IoT SDKs, modules can declare specific output queues for their messages using the ModuleClient class.

Output queues aren't necessary, but are helpful for managing multiple routes.

Leaf devices can use the DeviceClient class of the IoT SDKs to send messages to IoT Edge gateway devices in the same way that they would send messages to IoT Hub.

The source property can be any of the following values:

[%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|Source
|Description

|/*
|All device-to-cloud messages or twin change notifications from any module or leaf device.


|/twinChangeNotifications
|Any twin change (reported properties) coming from any module or leaf device.

|/messages/*
|Any device-to-cloud message sent by a module through some or no output, or by a leaf device.

|/messages/modules/*
|Any device-to-cloud message sent by a module through some or no output.

|/messages/modules/<moduleId>/*
|Any device-to-cloud message sent by a specific module through some or no output.

|/messages/modules/<moduleId>/outputs/*
|Any device-to-cloud message sent by a specific module through some output.

|/messages/modules/<moduleId>/outputs/<output>
|Any device-to-cloud message sent by a specific module through a specific output.

|===

[discrete]
==== Condition
The condition is optional in a route declaration.

If you want to pass all messages from the source to the sink, just leave out the WHERE clause entirely.

Or you can use the IoT Hub query language to filter for certain messages or message types that satisfy the condition.

IoT Edge routes don't support filtering messages based on twin tags or properties.

The messages that pass between modules in IoT Edge are formatted the same as the messages that pass between your devices and Azure IoT Hub.

All messages are formatted as JSON and have systemProperties, appProperties, and body parameters.

You can build queries around any of the three parameters with the following syntax:

* System properties: `$<propertyName>` or `\{$<propertyName>}`
* Application properties: `<propertyName>`
* Body properties: `$body.<propertyName>`

An example that is specific to IoT Edge is when you want to filter for messages that arrived at a gateway device from a leaf device.

Messages that come from modules include a system property called *connectionModuleId*.

So if you want to route messages from leaf devices directly to IoT Hub, use the following route to exclude module messages:

[source]
----
FROM /messages/* WHERE NOT IS_DEFINED($connectionModuleId) INTO $upstream
----

[discrete]
==== Sink
The sink defines where the messages are sent.

Only modules and IoT Hub can receive messages.

Messages can't be routed to other devices.

There are no wildcard options in the sink property.

The sink property can be any of the following values:

[%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|Sink
|Description

|$upstream
|Send the message to IoT Hub.

|BrokeredEndpoint("/modules/<moduleId>/inputs/<input>")
|Send the message to a specific input of a specific module.

|===

IoT Edge provides at-least-once guarantees.

The IoT Edge hub stores messages locally in case a route can't deliver the message to its sink.

For example, if the IoT Edge hub can't connect to IoT Hub, or the target module isn't connected.

IoT Edge hub stores the messages up to the time specified in the `storeAndForwardConfiguration.timeToLiveSecs` property of the IoT Edge hub desired properties.

[discrete]
=== Define or update desired properties
The deployment manifest specifies desired properties for each module deployed to the IoT Edge device.

Desired properties in the deployment manifest overwrite any desired properties currently in the module twin.

If you do not specify a module twin's desired properties in the deployment manifest, IoT Hub won't modify the module twin in any way.

Instead, you can set the desired properties programmatically.

The same mechanisms that allow you to modify device twins are used to modify module twins.

[discrete]
=== Deployment manifest example
The following example shows what a valid deployment manifest document may look like.

=== Examine pre-deployment considerations
When you're ready to take your IoT Edge solution from development into production, having a checklist will help you to ensure that your solution is configured for ongoing performance.

[NOTE]
====
Each section below begins by dividing associated work into two sections: important to complete before going to production, or helpful for you to know. This distinction is helpful when prioritizing efforts.
====

[discrete]
==== Device Configuration
IoT Edge devices can be anything from a Raspberry Pi to a laptop to a virtual machine running on a server.

You may have access to the device either physically or through a virtual connection, or it may be isolated for extended periods of time.

Either way, you want to make sure that it's configured to work appropriately.

* Important
** Install production certificates.
** Have a device management plan.
** Use Moby as the container engine.
* Helpful
** Choose upstream protocol.

[discrete]
===== Install production certificates
Every IoT Edge device in production needs a device certificate authority (CA) certificate installed on it.

That CA certificate is then declared to the IoT Edge runtime in the config.yaml file.

To make development and testing easier, the IoT Edge runtime creates temporary certificates if no certificates are declared in the config.yaml file.

However, these temporary certificates expire after three months and aren't secure for production scenarios.

The steps for configuring the certificates are the same whether the device is going to be used as a gateway or not.

You can generate sample certificates for testing, but never use sample certificates in production.

[discrete]
===== Have a device management plan
Before you put any device in production you should know how you're going to manage future updates.

For an IoT Edge device, the list of components to update may include:

* Device firmware.
* Operating system libraries.
* Container engine, like Moby.
* IoT Edge daemon.
* CA certificates.

The current methods for updating the IoT Edge daemon require physical or SSH access to the IoT Edge device.

If you have many devices to update, consider adding the update steps to a script or use an automation tool like Ansible.

[discrete]
===== Use Moby as the container engine
A container engine is a prerequisite for any IoT Edge device.

Only moby-engine is supported in production.

Other container engines, like Docker, do work with IoT Edge and it's ok to use these engines for development.

The moby-engine can be redistributed when used with Azure IoT Edge, and Microsoft provides servicing for this engine.

[discrete]
===== Choose upstream protocol
The protocol (and therefore the port used) for upstream communication to IoT Hub can be configured for both the IoT Edge agent and the IoT Edge hub.

The default protocol is AMQP, but you may want to change that depending on your network setup.

The two runtime modules both have an UpstreamProtocol environment variable.

The valid values for the variable are:

* MQTT
* AMQP
* MQTTWS
* AMQPWS

Configure the UpstreamProtocol variable for the IoT Edge agent in the config.yaml file on the device itself.

For example, if your IoT Edge device is behind a proxy server that blocks AMQP ports, you may need to configure the IoT Edge agent to use AMQP over WebSocket (AMQPWS) to establish the initial connection to IoT Hub.

Once your IoT Edge device connects, be sure to continue configuring the UpstreamProtocol variable for both runtime modules in future deployments.

An example of this process is provided in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-configure-proxy-support?view=iotedge-1.4[Configure an IoT Edge device to communicate through a proxy server].

[discrete]
=== Deployment
For your Deployment checklist, the following items fall into the helpful category.

[discrete]
==== Be consistent with upstream protocol
If you configured the IoT Edge agent on your IoT Edge device to use a different protocol than the default AMQP, then you should declare the same protocol in all future deployments. 

For example, if your IoT Edge device is behind a proxy server that blocks AMQP ports, you probably configured the device to connect over AMQP over WebSocket (AMQPWS).

When you deploy modules to the device, configure the same AMQPWS protocol for the IoT Edge agent and IoT Edge hub, or else the default AMQP will override the settings and prevent you from connecting again.

You only have to configure the UpstreamProtocol environment variable for the IoT Edge agent and IoT Edge hub modules.

Any other modules adopt whatever protocol is set in the runtime modules.

[discrete]
==== Set up host storage for system modules
The IoT Edge hub and agent modules use local storage to maintain state and enable messaging between modules, devices, and the cloud.

For better reliability and performance, configure the system modules to use storage on the host filesystem.

[discrete]
==== Reduce memory space used by IoT Edge hub
If you're deploying constrained devices with limited memory available, you can configure IoT Edge hub to run in a more streamlined capacity and use less disk space.

These configurations do limit the performance of the IoT Edge hub, however, so find the right balance that works for your solution.

Three guidelines that you can follow are:

* Don't optimize for performance on constrained devices.
* Disable unused protocols.
* Do not use debug versions of module images.

[discrete]
=== Container management
For your Container management checklist, the following items fall into the important category.

[discrete]
==== Use tags to manage versions
A tag is a docker concept that you can use to distinguish between versions of docker containers.

Tags are suffixes like 1.0 that go on the end of a container repository.

For example, mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-agent:1.0.

Tags are mutable and can be changed to point to another container at any time, so your team should agree on a convention to follow as you update your module images moving forward.

Tags also help you to enforce updates on your IoT Edge devices.

When you push an updated version of a module to your container registry, increment the tag.

Then, push a new deployment to your devices with the tag incremented.

The container engine will recognize the incremented tag as a new version and will pull the latest module version down to your device.

[discrete]
==== Tags for the IoT Edge runtime
The IoT Edge agent and IoT Edge hub images are tagged with the IoT Edge version that they are associated with.

here are two different ways to use tags with the runtime images:

* Rolling tags - Use only the first two values of the version number to get the latest image that matches those digits. For example, 1.1 is updated whenever there's a new release to point to the latest 1.1.x version. If the container runtime on your IoT Edge device pulls the image again, the runtime modules are updated to the latest version. Deployments from the Azure portal default to rolling tags. This approach is suggested for development purposes.
* Specific tags - Use all three values of the version number to explicitly set the image version. For example, 1.1.0 won't change after its initial release. You can declare a new version number in the deployment manifest when you're ready to update. This approach is suggested for production purposes.

[discrete]
=== Networking
For your Networking checklist, the following items fall into the helpful category.

[discrete]
==== Review outbound/inbound configuration
Communication channels between Azure IoT Hub and IoT Edge are always configured to be outbound.

For most IoT Edge scenarios, only three connections are necessary.

The container engine needs to connect with the container registry (or registries) that holds the module images.

The IoT Edge runtime needs to connect with IoT Hub to retrieve device configuration information, and to send messages and telemetry.

And if you use automatic provisioning, the IoT Edge daemon needs to connect to the Device Provisioning Service.

[discrete]
==== Allow connections from IoT Edge devices
If your networking setup requires that you explicitly permit connections made from IoT Edge devices, review the following list of IoT Edge components:

* IoT Edge agent opens a persistent AMQP/MQTT connection to IoT Hub, possibly over WebSockets.
* IoT Edge hub opens a single persistent AMQP connection or multiple MQTT connections to IoT Hub, possibly over WebSockets.
* IoT Edge daemon makes intermittent HTTPS calls to IoT Hub.

In all three cases, the DNS name would match the pattern *.azure-devices.net.

Additionally, the Container engine makes calls to container registries over HTTPS.

To retrieve the IoT Edge runtime container images, the DNS name is mcr.microsoft.com.

The container engine connects to other registries as configured in the deployment.

[discrete]
==== Configure communication through a proxy
If your devices are going to be deployed on a network that uses a proxy server, they need to be able to communicate through the proxy to reach IoT Hub and container registries.

[discrete]
=== Solution Management
For your Solution management checklist, the following items fall into the helpful category.

[discrete]
==== Set up logs and diagnostics
On Linux, the IoT Edge daemon uses journals as the default logging driver.

You can use the command-line tool `journalctl` to query the daemon logs. 

On Windows, the IoT Edge daemon uses PowerShell diagnostics.

Use `Get-IoTEdgeLog` to query logs from the daemon. 

IoT Edge modules use the JSON driver for logging, which is the default.

When you're testing an IoT Edge deployment, you can usually access your devices to retrieve logs and troubleshoot.

In a deployment scenario, you may not have that option.

Consider how you're going to gather information about your devices in production.

One option is to use a logging module that collects information from the other modules and sends it to the cloud.

[discrete]
==== Place limits on log size
By default the Moby container engine does not set container log size limits.

Over time this can lead to the device filling up with logs and running out of disk space.

[discrete]
=== Consider tests and CI/CD pipelines
For the most efficient IoT Edge deployment scenario, consider integrating your production deployment into your testing and CI/CD pipelines. 

Azure IoT Edge supports multiple CI/CD platforms, including Azure DevOps.

== IoT Edge Gateway Device Configuration
Gateways in IoT Edge solutions provide device connectivity and edge analytics to IoT devices that otherwise wouldn't have those capabilities.

Azure IoT Edge can be used to satisfy all needs for an IoT gateway regardless of whether they are related to connectivity, identity, or edge analytics.

Gateway patterns refer to characteristics of downstream device connectivity and device identity, not how device data is processed on the gateway.

[discrete]
=== IoT Edge device gateway patterns
There are three patterns for using an IoT Edge device as a gateway: transparent, protocol translation, and identity translation:

* Transparent
** Devices that theoretically could connect to IoT Hub can connect to a gateway device instead.
** The downstream devices have their own IoT Hub identities and are using any of the MQTT, AMQP, or HTTP protocols.
** The gateway simply passes communications between the devices and IoT Hub.
** The devices are unaware that they are communicating with the cloud via a gateway, and a user interacting with the devices in IoT Hub is unaware of the intermediate gateway device.
** Thus, the gateway is transparent.
* Protocol translation
** Also known as an opaque gateway pattern, devices that do not support MQTT, AMQP, or HTTP can use a gateway device to send data to IoT Hub on their behalf.
** The gateway understands the protocol used by the downstream devices and is the only device that has an identity in IoT Hub.
** All information looks like it is coming from one device, the gateway.
** Downstream devices must embed extra identifying information in their messages if cloud applications want to analyze the data on a per-device basis.
** Additionally, IoT Hub primitives like twins and methods are only available for the gateway device, not downstream devices.
* Identity translation
** Devices that cannot connect to IoT Hub directly can connect to a gateway device instead.
** The gateway provides IoT Hub identity and protocol translation on behalf of the downstream devices.
** The gateway is smart enough to understand the protocol used by the downstream devices, provide them identity, and translate IoT Hub primitives.
** Downstream devices appear in IoT Hub as first-class devices with twins and methods.
** A user can interact with the devices in IoT Hub and is unaware of the intermediate gateway device.

[discrete]
=== Use Cases
All gateway patterns provide the following benefits:

* Analytics at the edge
** Use AI services locally to process data coming from downstream devices without sending full-fidelity telemetry to the cloud. 
** Find and react to insights locally and only send a subset of data to IoT Hub.
* Downstream device isolation
** The gateway device can shield all downstream devices from exposure to the Internet.
** It can sit in between an OT network that does not have connectivity and an IT network that provides access to the web.
* Connection multiplexing
** All devices connecting to IoT Hub through an IoT Edge gateway use the same underlying connection.
* Traffic smoothing
** The IoT Edge device will automatically implement exponential backoff if IoT Hub throttles traffic, while persisting the messages locally.
** This benefit makes your solution resilient to spikes in traffic.
* Offline support
** The gateway device stores messages and twin updates that cannot be delivered to IoT Hub.

== IoT Edge Module Development

[discrete]
=== IoT Edge runtime environment
The IoT Edge runtime provides the infrastructure to integrate the functionality of multiple IoT Edge modules and to deploy them onto IoT Edge devices.

At a high level, any program can be packaged as an IoT Edge module.

However, to take full advantage of IoT Edge communication and management functionalities, a program running in a module can use the Azure IoT Device SDK to connect to the local IoT Edge hub.

[discrete]
=== Connecting to IoT Edge hub from a module
Connecting to the local IoT Edge hub from a module involves two steps:

. Create a ModuleClient instance in your application.
. Make sure your application accepts the certificate presented by the IoT Edge hub on that device.

To use IoT Edge routing over AMQP or MQTT, you can use the ModuleClient from the Azure IoT SDK.

Create a ModuleClient instance to connect your module to the IoT Edge hub running on the device, similar to how DeviceClient instances connect IoT devices to IoT Hub.

[discrete]
=== IoT Hub primitives
IoT Hub sees a module instance analogously to a device, in the sense that:

* It has a module twin that is distinct and isolated from the device twin and the other module twins of that device.
* It can send device-to-cloud messages.
* It can receive direct methods targeted specifically at its identity.

Currently, modules cannot receive cloud-to-device messages or use the file upload feature.

When writing a module, you can connect to the IoT Edge hub and use IoT Hub primitives as you would when using IoT Hub with a device application. 

The only difference between IoT Edge modules and IoT device applications is that you have to refer to the module identity instead of the device identity.

[discrete]
=== Device-to-cloud messages
An IoT Edge module can send messages to the cloud via the IoT Edge hub that acts as a local broker and propagates messages to the cloud.

To enable complex processing of device-to-cloud messages, an IoT Edge module can also intercept and process messages sent by other modules or devices to its local IoT Edge hub and send new messages with processed data.

Chains of IoT Edge modules can thus be created to build local processing pipelines.

To send device-to-cloud telemetry messages using routing, use the ModuleClient of the Azure IoT SDK.

With the Azure IoT SDK, each module has the concept of module input and output endpoints, which map to special MQTT topics.

Use the ModuleClient.sendMessageAsync method and it will send messages on the output endpoint of your module.

Then configure a route in edgeHub to send this output endpoint to IoT Hub.

To process messages using routing, first set up a route to send messages coming from another endpoint (module or device) to the input endpoint of your module, then listen for messages on the input endpoint of your module.

Each time a new message comes back, a callback function is triggered by the Azure IoT SDK. 

Process your message with this callback function and optionally send new messages on your module endpoint queue.

[discrete]
=== Twins
Twins are one of the primitives provided by IoT Hub.

There are JSON documents that store state information including metadata, configurations, and conditions. 

Each module or device has its own twin.

To get a module twin with the Azure IoT SDK, call the ModuleClient.getTwin method.

To get a module twin with any MQTT client, slightly more work is involved since getting a twin is not a typical MQTT pattern.

To receive a module twin patch with the Azure IoT SDK, implement a callback function and register it with the ModuleClient.moduleTwinCallback method from the Azure IoT SDK so that your callback function is triggered each time that a twin patch comes in.

To receive a module twin patch with any MQTT client, the process is similar to receiving full twins: a client needs to subscribe to special IoT Hub topic $iothub/twin/PATCH/properties/desired/#.

After the subscription is made, when IoT Hub sends a change of the desired section of the twin, the client receives it.

[discrete]
=== Receive direct methods
To receive a direct method with the Azure IoT SDK, implement a callback function and register it with the ModuleClient.methodCallback method from the Azure IoT SDK so that your callback function is triggered each time that a direct method comes in.

To receive a direct method with any MQTT client, the process is similar to receiving twin patches.

The client needs to confirm back that it has received the call and can send back some information at the same time.

[discrete]
=== IoT Edge runtime supported systems
It is important to understand which systems and components are supported by IoT Edge, whether officially or in preview.

For the full list of IoT Edge releases and support documentation, see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/support?view=iotedge-1.4[Azure IoT Edge supported systems]


.Container Engines
Azure IoT Edge modules are implemented as containers, so IoT Edge needs a container engine to launch them.

Microsoft provides a container engine, moby-engine, to fulfill this requirement. 

This container engine is based on the Moby open-source project. 


image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-iot-edge-module-development/media/m07-l01-edge-modules-containers-only-moby-production-addd36ef.png[]


.Operating Systems
Operating systems are grouped into tiers that represent the level of support users can expect.

Tier 1 systems are supported. For tier 1 systems, Microsoft:
* Has this operating system in automated tests.
* Provides installation packages for them.

Tier 2 systems are compatible with Azure IoT Edge and can be used relatively easily. For tier 2 systems: 
* Microsoft has done some preliminary testing on the platforms or knows of a partner successfully running Azure IoT Edge on the platform.
* Installation packages for other platforms may work on these platforms.

The family of the host OS must always match the family of the guest OS used inside a module's container.

image:: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-iot-edge-module-development/media/m07-l01-edge-modules-containers-edge-device-8fc429bd.png[]

.Virtual Machines
Azure IoT Edge can be run in virtual machines.

Using a virtual machine as an IoT Edge device is common when customers want to augment existing infrastructure with edge intelligence.

The family of the host VM OS must match the family of the guest OS used inside a module's container.

Azure IoT Edge is agnostic of the underlying virtualization technology and works in VMs powered by platforms like Hyper-V and vSphere.

.Minimum system requirements
Azure IoT Edge runs great on devices as small as a Raspberry Pi3 to server grade hardware.

Choosing the right hardware for your scenario depends on the workloads that you want to run.

Making the final device decision can be complicated; however, you can easily start prototyping a solution on traditional laptops or desktops.

Experience while prototyping will help guide your final device selection. Questions you should consider include:

* How many modules are in your workload?
* How many layers do your modules’ containers share?
* In what language are your modules written?
* How much data will your modules be processing?
* Do your modules need any specialized hardware for accelerating their workloads?
* What are the desired performance characteristics of your solution?
* What is your hardware budget?

== Module Development and Testing
Azure IoT Edge moves your existing business logic to devices operating at the edge.

To prepare your applications and workloads to run as IoT Edge modules, you need to build them as containers.

In any IoT Edge solution, there are at least two machines to consider.

One is the IoT Edge device (or devices) itself, which runs the IoT Edge module.

The other is the development machine that you use to build, test, and deploy modules.

For testing purposes, the two machines can be the same. You can run IoT Edge on your development machine and deploy modules to it.

.Operating Systems
For developing for IoT Edge, you can use most operating systems that can run a container engine.

The container engine is a requirement on the development machine to build your modules as containers and push them to a container registry.

The operating system of your development machine doesn't have to match the operating system of your IoT Edge device.

However, the container operating system must be consistent between development machine and IoT Edge device.

For example, you can develop modules on a Windows machine and deploy them to a Linux device.

The Windows machine needs to run Linux containers to build the modules for the Linux device.

.Container Engine
The central concept of IoT Edge is that you can remotely deploy your business and cloud logic to devices by packaging it into containers.

To build containers, you need a container engine on your development machine.

The only supported container engine for IoT Edge devices in production is Moby.

However, any container engine compatible with the Open Container Initiative, like Docker, is capable of building IoT Edge module images.

.Development Tools
Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have add-on extensions to help develop IoT Edge solutions.

These extensions provide language-specific templates to help create and deploy new IoT Edge scenarios. 

The Azure IoT Edge extensions for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code help you code, build, deploy, and debug your IoT Edge solutions.

You can create an entire IoT Edge solution that contains multiple modules, and the extensions automatically update a deployment manifest template with each new module addition.

With the extensions, you can also manage your IoT devices from within Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

Deploy modules to a device, monitor the status, and view messages as they arrive at IoT Hub.

Both extensions use the IoT EdgeHub dev tool to enable local running and debugging of modules on your development machine as well.

.IoT Edge Dev Tools
The Azure IoT Edge dev tool simplifies IoT Edge development with command-line abilities.

This tool provides CLI commands to develop, debug, and test modules.

 The IoT Edge dev tool works with your development system, whether you've manually installed the dependencies on your machine or are using the IoT Edge dev container.

 https://github.com/Azure/iotedgedev/wiki

.Testing Tools
Several testing tools exist to help you simulate IoT Edge devices or debug modules more efficiently.

Only the IoT Edge runtime is supported for production deployments, but the following tools allow you to simulate or easily create IoT Edge devices for development and testing purposes. 

These tools aren't mutually exclusive, but can work together for a complete development experience.

.IoT EdgeHub dev tool
The Azure IoT EdgeHub dev tool provides a local development and debug experience.

The tool helps start IoT Edge modules without the IoT Edge runtime so that you can create, develop, test, run, and debug IoT Edge modules and solutions locally.

You don't have to push images to a container registry and deploy them to a device for testing.

The IoT EdgeHub dev tool was designed to work in tandem with the Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code extensions, and it works with the IoT Edge dev tool.

It supports inner loop development and outer loop testing, so it integrates with the DevOps tools.

https://pypi.org/project/iotedgehubdev/

.IoT Edge dev container
The Azure IoT Edge dev container is a Docker container that has all the dependencies that you need for IoT Edge development.

This container makes it easy to get started with whichever language you want to develop in, including C#, Python, Node.js, and Java.

All you need to install is a container engine, like Docker or Moby, to pull the container to your development machine.

https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iotedgedev/

.IoT Edge runtime in a container
The IoT Edge runtime in a container provides a complete runtime that takes your device connection string as an environment variable.

This container enables you to test IoT Edge modules and scenarios on a system that may not support the runtime natively, like macOS.

Any modules that you deploy will be started outside of the runtime container.

If you want the runtime and any deployed modules to exist within the same container, consider the IoT Edge device container instead.

https://github.com/toolboc/azure-iot-edge-device-container

.IoT Edge device container
The IoT Edge device container is a complete IoT Edge device, ready to be launched on any machine with a container engine.

The device container includes the IoT Edge runtime and a container engine itself.

Each instance of the container is a fully functional self-provisioning IoT Edge device.

The device container supports remote debugging of modules, as long as there is a network route to the module.

The device container is good for quickly creating large numbers of IoT Edge devices to test at-scale scenarios or Azure Pipelines.

It also supports deployment to kubernetes via helm.

== Offline and Local Storage Capabilities
Azure IoT Edge supports extended offline operations on your IoT Edge devices, and enables offline operations on non-IoT Edge child devices too.

As long as an IoT Edge device has had one opportunity to connect to IoT Hub, it and any child devices can continue to function with intermittent or no Internet connection.

When an IoT Edge device goes into offline mode, the IoT Edge hub takes on three roles.

First, it stores any messages that would go upstream and saves them until the device reconnects.

Second, it acts on behalf of IoT Hub to authenticate modules and child devices so that they can continue to operate.

Third, it enables communication between child devices that normally would go through IoT Hub.

The following example shows how an IoT Edge scenario operates in offline mode:

. *Configure devices* 
  * IoT Edge devices automatically have offline capabilities enabled.
  * To extend that capability to other IoT devices, you need to declare a parent-child relationship between the devices in IoT Hub.
  * Then, you configure the child devices to trust their assigned parent device and route the device-to-cloud communications through the parent as a gateway.

. *Sync with IoT Hub*
  * At least once after installation of the IoT Edge runtime, the IoT Edge device needs to be online to sync with IoT Hub.
  * In this sync, the IoT Edge device gets details about any child devices assigned to it.
  * The IoT Edge device also securely updates its local cache to enable offline operations and retrieves settings for local storage of telemetry messages.

. *Go offline*
  * While disconnected from IoT Hub, the IoT Edge device, its deployed modules, and any children IoT devices can operate indefinitely.
  * Modules and child devices can start and restart by authenticating with the IoT Edge hub while offline.
  * Telemetry bound upstream to IoT Hub is stored locally.
  * Communication between modules or between child IoT devices is maintained through direct methods or messages.

. *Reconnect and resync with IoT Hub*
  * Once the connection with IoT Hub is restored, the IoT Edge device syncs again.
  * Locally stored messages are delivered in the same order in which they were stored.
  * Any differences between the desired and reported properties of the modules and devices are reconciled.
  * The IoT Edge device updates any changes to its set of assigned child IoT devices.

.Restrictions and limits
The extended offline capabilities described here are available in IoT Edge version 1.0.7 or higher.

Existing IoT Edge devices that don't have extended offline capabilities can't be upgraded by changing the runtime version, but must be reconfigured with a new IoT Edge device identity to gain these features.

IoT Edge devices and their assigned child devices can function indefinitely offline after the initial, one-time sync.

However, storage of messages depends on the time to live (TTL) setting and the available disk space for storing the messages.

[discrete]
=== Set up parent and child devices

For an IoT Edge device to extend its extended offline capabilities to child IoT devices, you need to complete two steps.

First, declare the parent-child relationships in the Azure portal.

Second, create a trust relationship between the parent device and any child devices, then configure device-to-cloud communications to go through the parent as a gateway.

.Assign Child Devices
Child devices can be any non-IoT Edge device registered to the same IoT Hub.

Parent devices can have multiple child devices, but a child device only has one parent.

There are three options to set child devices to an edge device: through the Azure portal, using the Azure CLI, or using the IoT Hub service SDK.

.Option 1: IoT Hub Portal
You can declare the parent-child relationship when creating a new device.

Or for existing devices, you can declare the relationship from the device details page of either the parent IoT Edge device or the child IoT device.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-offline-local-storage-capabilities/media/m06-l03-edge-gateway-manage-child-devices-b7de833f.png[]

.Option 2: Use the az command-line tool
Using the Azure command-line interface with IoT extension (v0.7.0 or newer), you can manage parent child relationships with the device-identity subcommands.

[souce,bash]
====
# Set IoT Edge parent device
egde_device="edge-device1"

# Get All IoT Devices
device_list=$(az iot hub query \
        --hub-name replace-with-hub-name \
        --subscription replace-with-sub-name \
        --resource-group replace-with-rg-name \
        -q "SELECT * FROM devices WHERE capabilities.iotEdge = false" \
        --query 'join(`, `, [].deviceId)' -o tsv)

# Add all IoT devices to IoT Edge (as child)
az iot hub device-identity add-children \
  --device-id $egde_device \
  --child-list $device_list \
  --hub-name replace-with-hub-name \
  --resource-group replace-with-rg-name \
  --subscription replace-with-sub-name
====

.Option 3: Use IoT Hub Service SDK
Finally, you can manage parent child relationships programmatically using either C#, Java or Node.js IoT Hub Service SDK.

.Set up the parent device as a gateway
You can think of a parent/child relationship as a transparent gateway, where the child device has its own identity in IoT Hub but communicates through the cloud via its parent.

For secure communication, the child device needs to be able to verify that the parent device comes from a trusted source. 

Otherwise, third-parties could set up malicious devices to impersonate parents and intercept communications.

.Specify DNS servers
To improve robustness, it is highly recommended you specify the DNS server addresses used in your environment.

To set your DNS server for IoT Edge, either set DNS server address in container engine settings or per module in the IoT Edge deployment.

For more information, see the resolution for *Edge Agent module continually reports 'empty config file' and no modules start on device* in the troubleshooting article https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/troubleshoot[Troubleshoot your IoT Edge device].

.Optional offline settings
If your devices go offline, the IoT Edge parent device stores all device-to-cloud messages until the connection is reestablished.

The IoT Edge hub module manages the storage and forwarding of offline messages.

For devices that may go offline for extended periods of time, optimize performance by configuring two IoT Edge hub settings.

First, increase the time to live setting so that the IoT Edge hub will keep messages long enough for your device to reconnect. Then, add more disk space for message storage.

.Time to live
The time to live setting is the amount of time (in seconds) that a message can wait to be delivered before it expires.

The default is 7200 seconds (two hours).

The maximum value is only limited by the maximum value of an integer variable, which is around 2 billion.

This setting is a desired property of the IoT Edge hub, which is stored in the module twin.

You can configure it in the Azure portal or directly in the deployment manifest.

[source,json]
====
"$edgeHub": {
    "properties.desired": {
        "schemaVersion": "1.0",
        "routes": {},
        "storeAndForwardConfiguration": {
            "timeToLiveSecs": 7200
        }
    }
}
====

There are several things to consider when configuring the Message Time-to-Live (TTL) for theEdge Hub ($edgeHub) module.

When the IoT Edge Device is disconnected, the messages are stored on the local device.

You need to calculate how much data will be stored during the TTL period, and make sure there is enough storage on the device for that much data.

The amount of storage and TTL configured will need to meet the solutions requirements if you want to avoid the loss of important data. 

The storage location can be configured using a *HostConfig* object.

.Host storage for system modules
Messages and module state information are stored in the IoT Edge hub's local container filesystem by default.

For improved reliability, especially when operating offline, you can also dedicate storage on the host IoT Edge device.

== Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge
Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge provides a block blob storage solution at the edge.

A blob storage module on your IoT Edge device behaves like an Azure block blob service, except the block blobs are stored locally on your IoT Edge device.

You can access your blobs using the same Azure storage SDK methods or block blob API calls that you're already used to.

A blob storage module is useful in the following scenarios:

* Where data needs to be stored locally until it can be processed or transferred to the cloud. This data can be videos, images, finance data, hospital data, or any other unstructured data.
* When devices are located in a place with limited connectivity.
* When you want to efficiently process the data locally to get low latency access to the data, such that you can respond to emergencies as quickly as possible.
* When you want to reduce bandwidth costs and avoid transferring terabytes of data to the cloud. You can process the data locally and send only the processed data to the cloud.

[NOTE]
====
Azure SQL Edge is another local storage option for IoT Edge devices.
Azure SQL Edge is an optimized relational database engine geared for IoT and IoT Edge deployments.
====

To understand how to setup and configure Azure Blob Storage follow the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/examine-offline-local-storage-capabilities/3-azure-blob-storage-iot-edge[link]

.Module access to local storage
In addition to storing data using Azure storage services or in your device's container storage, you can also dedicate storage on the host IoT Edge device itself for improved reliability, especially when operating offline.

To understand how to use and configure module access to local storage. Please read the link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/examine-offline-local-storage-capabilities/4-module-access-local-storage[here]

In addition to using the container create options to enable access to local/host storage, scenarios that come up most often when building IoT Edge solutions include:
* Map host port to module port
* Restrict module memory and CPU usage

You can find detailed information for implementing these scenarios here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-use-create-options[How to configure container create options for IoT Edge modules.]

You can find more details about create options from docker docs https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.32/#operation/ContainerCreate[]


== Manage IoT devices by using IoT Hub and apps

[discrete]
=== Device Management Patterns
Back-end apps can use Azure IoT Hub primitives, such as device twins and direct methods, to remotely start and monitor device management actions on devices.

[discrete]
==== Patterns
IoT Hub enables the following set of device management patterns.

. *Reboot*
  * The back-end app informs the device through a direct method that it has initiated a reboot.
  * The device uses the reported properties to update the reboot status of the device.
+
--

--

. *Factory Reset*
  * The back-end app informs the device through a direct method that it has initiated a factory reset.
  * The device uses the reported properties to update the factory reset status of the device.
+
--
image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-management-concepts-methods/media/m08-l01-device-management-factory-reset-pattern-ae2bcf97.png[]
--

. *Configuration*
  * The back-end app uses the desired properties to configure software running on the device.
  * The device uses the reported properties to update configuration status of the device.
+
--
image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-management-concepts-methods/media/m08-l01-device-management-configuration-pattern-b0be34d8.png[]
--

. *Firmware update*
  * The back-end app uses an automatic device management configuration to select the devices to receive the update, to tell the devices where to find the update, and to monitor the update process.
  * The device initiates a multistep process to download, verify, and apply the firmware image, and then reboot the device before reconnecting to the IoT Hub service.
  * Throughout the multistep process, the device uses the reported properties to update the progress and status of the device.
+
--
image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-management-concepts-methods/media/m08-l01-device-management-firmware-update-pattern-3deee818.png[]
--

. *Reporting progress and status*
  * The solution back end runs device twin queries, across a set of devices, to report on the status and progress of actions running on the devices.
+
--
image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-management-concepts-methods/media/m08-l01-device-management-reporting-progress-status-pattern-970ff9d5.png[]
--

[discrete]
==== Approaches
You can use a direct method to initiate device management actions (such as reboot, factory reset, and firmware update) from a back-end app in the cloud.

The device is responsible for:
* Handling the method request sent from IoT Hub.
* Initiating the corresponding device-specific action on the device.
* Providing status updates through reported properties to IoT Hub.

You can use a back-end app in the cloud to run device twin queries to set a device twin desired property or to report on the progress of your device management actions.

The device is responsible for:
* Handling the property changed event and updating the local variables that correspond to the device twin desired property.
* Communicating the device twin reported property setting to IoT hub after the updated desired property has been implemented successfully.

== Device Configuration using Device Twins
Configuring devices from your back-end service is a core component of most device management solutions.

To synchronize state information between a device and an IoT hub, you use device twins.

A desired property is set by a back-end application and read by a device.

A reported property is set by a device and read by a back-end application.

Device Twins also include a tag that is set by a back-end application, but is never sent to the device.

You use tags to provide descriptive information, such as location, or to help organize/differentiate your devices.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-device-management-concepts-methods/media/m08-l01-device-management-using-device-twin-properties-4defa110.png[]

[discrete]
=== Device Twin Properties
Consider the following "properties" section of a device twin document:

[source,json]
====
"properties": {
        "desired": {
            "telemetryConfig": {
                "sendFrequency": "5m"
            },
            "$metadata" : {...},
            "$version": 1
        },
        "reported": {
            "telemetryConfig": {
                "sendFrequency": "5m",
                "status": "success"
            },
            "$metadata" : {...},
            "$version": 4
        }
    }
====

The `telemetryConfig` device twin desired and reported properties are used by the solution back end and the device app to synchronize the telemetry configuration for this device.

An update to the device configuration could be implemented as follows:

. The solution back end sets the desired property with the desired configuration value.
. The device app is notified of the change immediately if connected, or at the first reconnect.
. The device app then reports the updated configuration (or an error condition using the `status` property).
. The solution back end can track the results of the configuration operation across many devices by querying device twins.

[discrete]
==== Back-end operations

The solution back end operates on the device twin using the following atomic operations, exposed through HTTPS:

* *Retrieve device twin by ID.* 
** This operation returns the device twin document, including tags and desired and reported system properties.

* *Partially update device twin*
** This operation enables the solution back end to partially update the tags or desired properties in a device twin.
** The partial update is expressed as a JSON document that adds or updates any property.
** Properties set to `null` are removed.
** The following example creates a new desired property with value `{"newProperty": "newValue"}`, overwrites the existing value of existingProperty with `"otherNewValue"`, and removes `otherOldProperty`. No other changes are made to existing desired properties or tags:
+
[source,json]
====
{
        "properties": {
            "desired": {
                "newProperty": {
                    "nestedProperty": "newValue"
                },
                "existingProperty": "otherNewValue",
                "otherOldProperty": null
            }
        }
}

* *Replace desired properties*
** This operation enables the solution back end to completely overwrite all existing desired properties and substitute a new JSON document for `properties/desired`.

* *Replace tags*
** This operation enables the solution back end to completely overwrite all existing tags and substitute a new JSON document for `tags`.

* *Receive twin notifications.*
** This operation allows the solution back end to be notified when the twin is modified.
** To do so, your IoT solution needs to create a route and to set the Data Source equal to twinChangeEvents.
** By default, no such routes pre-exist, so no twin notifications are sent. If the rate of change is too high, or for other reasons such as internal failures, the IoT Hub might send only one notification that contains all changes.
** Therefore, if your application needs reliable auditing and logging of all intermediate states, you should use device-to-cloud messages.
** The twin notification message includes properties and body.
** *Properties* The properties for a twin notification message are shown in the following table. 
    

In addition to these operations, the solution back end can:
* Query the device twins using the SQL-like IoT Hub query language.
* Perform operations on large set of device twins using jobs.

=== Environment and service goals
Azure Digital Twins is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that enables the creation of knowledge graphs (a way to integrate information extracted from multiple data sources).

In the case of Azure Digital Twins, the knowledge graph is based on interconnected digital entities that combine to represent a larger, interactive environment.

The size and complexity of the environment is dependent upon your business needs, and could represent things like buildings, factories, farms, energy networks, railways, stadiums, and more—even entire cities.

The digital entities defined within your environment, which are referred to as digital twins within an Azure Digital Twins solution, can be used to gain insights that drive better products, optimized operations, reduced costs, and breakthrough customer experiences.

Azure Digital Twins can be used to build customized, connected solutions that:

* Model any environment, and bring digital twins to life in a scalable and secure manner.
* Connect assets such as IoT devices and existing business systems
* Use a robust event system to build dynamic business logic and data processing.
* Integrate with Azure data, analytics, and AI services to help you track the past and then predict the future.

[Note]
====
* Digital twins (in Azure Digital Twins) and device twins (in IoT Hub) may sound similar, but they are two different things.
* IoT Hub device twins often focus on describing the aspects and capabilities of a device itself
* Digital twins are more conceptual representations that can store user-defined insights about a digital entity or many related entities.
* Entities that could be representing a device or many related devices.
* It is also worth noting that IoT Hub device twins can be connected to Azure Digital Twins (the service) as part of an end-to-end solution that represents devices across services.

==== Simple Azure Digital Twins environment scenario

iamge::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-components-azure-digital-twins-solution/media/m11-l02-simple-twins-environment-fb572ff0.png[]

Consider the following example where we define an environment that represents a small building (the Azure Digital Twins graph shown above).

In this example, our building is composed of digital twins that represent the floors of the building, and the rooms on each floor.

The lines on the Graph that connect a Floor to a Room are called relationships.

Relationships help to define how our digital twins are related to one another.

In this case, the relationship tells us that a floor “contains” rooms.

The graph shows that our building has two floors, and each floor contains one room, but our environment could be expanded to include more floors and more rooms on each floor, or we could create more levels of detail, such as adding digital twins that represent digital entities within the rooms.

[discrete]
=== Services and data workflows that form an Azure Digital Twins solution

Azure Digital Twins is typically used together with other services to create flexible, connected solutions that use your data in various workflows.

* Using event routes, Azure Digital Twins can receive data from upstream services such as IoT Hub or Logic Apps, which are used to deliver telemetry and notifications.
* Azure Digital Twins can also route data to downstream services, such as Azure Maps and Time Series Insights, for storage, workflow integration, analytics, and more.

[discrete]
==== Data Ingress
Azure Digital Twins can be driven with data and events from any service—IoT Hub, Logic Apps, your own custom service, and more.

This capability allows you to collect telemetry from physical devices in your environment, and process this data using the Azure Digital Twins graph in the cloud.

Instead of having a built-in IoT Hub behind the scenes, Azure Digital Twins allows you to "bring your own" IoT Hub to use with the service.

You can use an existing IoT Hub you currently have in production, or deploy a new one to be used for this purpose.

This capability gives you full access to all of the device management capabilities of IoT Hub.

To ingest data from any source into Azure Digital Twins, use an Azure function.

[discrete]
==== Data egress services
Azure Digital Twins can send data to connected endpoints. Supported endpoints can be:

* Event Hubs
* Event Grids
* Service Bus

Endpoints are attached to Azure Digital Twins using management APIs or the Azure portal.

There are many other services where you may want to ultimately direct your data, such as Azure Storage, Azure Maps, or Time Series Insights.

To send your data to services like these, attach the destination service to an endpoint.

For example, if you are also using Azure Maps and want to correlate location with your Azure Digital Twins twin graph, you can use Azure Functions with Event Grid to establish communication between all the services in your deployment.

[discrete]
==== Azure Digital Twins in a solution context
Azure Digital Twins is commonly used in combination with other Azure services as part of a larger IoT solution.

A complete solution using Azure Digital Twins may contain the following parts:

* The Azure Digital Twins service instance. The Azure Digital Twins service stores your twin graph with its state and orchestrates event processing.
* One or more client apps that may be used when building the Azure Digital Twins solution (to create digital entities and a topology, or to extract insights from the twin graph).
* One or more external compute resources to process events generated by Azure Digital Twins, or by connected data sources such as devices. One common way to provide compute resources is via Azure Functions.
* An IoT hub to provide device management and IoT data stream capabilities.
* Downstream services to handle tasks such as workflow integration (like Logic Apps, cold storage, time series integration, or analytics).

[discrete]
=== Azure Digital Twins models
In an Azure Digital Twins solution, Models provide the blueprint that is used to create the digital twin entities within your Azure Digital Twins environment.

Consider this example of an Azure Digital Twins environment expressed as a graph.

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-components-azure-digital-twins-solution/media/m11-l02-simple-twins-environment-fb572ff0.png[]

The nodes that you see in this graph are the digital twin instances that were created using the corresponding Model (either a Floor or a Room model).

Models have names (such as Floor, Room, or TemperatureSensor), and contain elements such as properties, telemetry/events, and relationships that describe how the digital twin entities are related to each other within your environment.

[discrete]
==== Elements of a model
Azure Digital Twins models are defined using the Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL), which is expressed using a JSON-style coding format.

Within a model definition, the top-level code item is an Interface, which encapsulates the entire model.

A DTDL model interface may contain zero, one, or many of each of the following fields:

* *Property*
** Properties are data fields that represent the state of an entity.
** Like the properties in many object-oriented programming languages.
** Properties have backing storage and can be read at any time.
* *Telemetry*
** Telemetry fields represent measurements or events, and are often used to describe device sensor readings.
** Unlike properties, telemetry is not stored on a digital twin; it is a series of time-bound data events that need to be handled as they occur.
* *Component*
** Components allow you to build your model interface as an assembly of other interfaces, if you want.
** An example of a component is a frontCamera interface (and another component interface backCamera) that are used in defining a model for a phone.
** You must first define an interface for frontCamera as though it were its own model, and then you can reference it when defining Phone.
** Use a component to describe something that is an integral part of your solution but doesn't need a separate identity, and doesn't need to be created, deleted, or rearranged in the twin graph independently.
** If you want entities to have independent existences in the twin graph, represent them as separate digital twins of different models, connected by relationships
* *Relationship*
** Relationships let you represent how a digital twin can be involved with other digital twins.
** Relationships can represent different semantic meanings, such as contains ("floor contains room"), cools ("hvac cools room"), isBilledTo ("compressor is billed to user"), etc.
** Relationships allow the solution to provide a graph of interrelated entities.

[discrete]
==== Differentiating between property and telemetry fields
Since property and telemetry fields could both represent numeric data, it may not be obvious when or where each should be used.

Here is some more guidance on distinguishing between DTDL property and telemetry fields in Azure Digital Twins.

The difference between properties and telemetry for Azure Digital Twins models is as follows:

* *Properties*
** Properties are expected to have backing storage (a stored and accessible value).
** You can read a property at any time and retrieve its value.
** If the property is writeable, you can also assign a value to the property.
* *Telemetry*
** Telemetry is more like a stream of events; it’s a set of data messages that have short lifespans.
** If you don't monitor for a telemetry event and take actions when it happens, there is no trace of the event at a later time.
** You can't come back to it and read it later. 
*** In C# terms, telemetry is like a C# event.
*** In IoT terms, telemetry is typically a data value sent by a device at a specified time interval.

[discrete]
==== Applying property and telemetry fields in an IoT context
When designing a model, a telemetry field is often used in models that represent IoT devices.

In this case, you will typically monitor incoming device data and take actions as the data arrives.

A property field is used most often when designing a model because properties provide you with backing storage and the ability to read and query the data fields.

[discrete]
==== Property and telemetry fields example
Consider the following example:

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-components-azure-digital-twins-solution/media/m11-l02-telemetry-property-fields-twins-model-89781ba3.png[]


* IoT hub: IoT device with temperature sensor is connected to IoT hub.
* Azure Digital Twins model - telemetry field: Azure Function is used to deliver IoT telemetry data to Azure Digital Twins device twin (temp01).
* Azure Digital Twins model - property field: Monitor temp01 telemetry field events and capture “last received” value and “last received time” value. Store values in last_received and last_received_time property fields.
* Query model properties: Query as needed to extract most recently reported temperature and time.

[discrete]
=== Digital Twins Definition Language
Models for Azure Digital Twins are defined using the Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL), which is based on JSON-LD and is programming-language independent.

[discrete]
==== Implementation Specifics
For a DTDL model to be compatible with Azure Digital Twins, it must meet these requirements.

* All top-level DTDL elements in a model must be of type interface.
** Azure Digital Twins model APIs can receive JSON objects that represent either an interface or an array of interfaces.
**  As a result, no other DTDL element types are allowed at the top level.
* DTDL for Azure Digital Twins must not define any commands.
* Azure Digital Twins only allows a single level of component nesting.
** This requirement means that an interface that's being used as a component can't have any components itself.
* Interfaces can't be defined inline within other DTDL interfaces; they must be defined as separate top-level entities with their own IDs. 
** Then, when another interface wants to include that interface as a component or through inheritance, it can reference its ID.

[discrete]
==== Example model code
Twin type models can be written in any text editor.

Consider a solar system environment that contains models for planets, each with a name, a mass, and a temperature.

Each of the planets may also interact with moons that are their satellites, and the planets may contain craters.

In the DTDL code example below, the Planet model expresses connections to these other entities by referencing two external models—Moon and Crater.

These external models are also defined in the example code below, but are kept simple so as not to detract from the primary Planet example.

[source,json]
====
[
{
  "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Planet;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
  "displayName": "Planet",
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "name",
      "schema": "string"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Property",
      "name": "mass",
      "schema": "double"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Telemetry",
      "name": "Temperature",
      "schema": "double"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Relationship",
      "name": "satellites",
      "target": "dtmi:com:contoso:Moon;1"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Component",
      "name": "deepestCrater",
      "schema": "dtmi:com:contoso:Crater;1"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Crater;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2"
},
{
  "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Moon;1",
  "@type": "Interface",
  "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2"
}
]
====

The fields of the model are:

* *@id*
** An identifier for the model. Must be in the following format: dtmi:<domain>:<unique model identifier>;<model version number>
* *@type*
** Identifies the kind of information being described. For an interface, the type is Interface.
* *@context*
** Sets the context for the JSON document. Models should use the following: dtmi:dtdl:context;2
* *@displayName*
** (optional) Allows you to give the model a friendly name if desired.
* *contents*
** All remaining interface data is placed here, as an array of attribute definitions.
** Each attribute must provide an @type (Property, Telemetry, Command, Relationship, or Component) to identify the type of interface information it describes, and then a set of properties that define the actual attribute (for example, name and schema to define a Property).

[discrete]
==== Possible schemas
As per DTDL, the schema for Property and Telemetry attributes can be of standard primitive types—integer, double, string, and Boolean—and other types such as DateTime and Duration.

In addition to primitive types, Property and Telemetry fields can have these complex types:

* Object
* Map
* Enum

Telemetry fields also support the Array type.

[discrete]
==== Model inheritance
Sometimes, you may want to specialize a model further.

For example, it might be useful to have a generic model Room, and specialized variants ConferenceRoom and Gym.

To express specialization, DTDL supports inheritance: interfaces can inherit from one or more other interfaces.

The following example reimagines the Planet model from the earlier DTDL example as a subtype of a larger CelestialBody model.

The "parent" model is defined first, and then the "child" model builds on it by using the field “extends”.

[source,json]
====
[
{
    "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:CelestialBody;1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
    "displayName": "Celestial body",
    "contents": [
    {
        "@type": "Property",
        "name": "name",
        "schema": "string"
    },
    {
        "@type": "Property",
        "name": "mass",
        "schema": "double"
    },
    {
        "@type": "Telemetry",
        "name": "temperature",
        "schema": "double"
    }
    ]
},
{
    "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Planet;1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2",
    "displayName": "Planet",
    "extends": "dtmi:com:contoso:CelestialBody;1",
    "contents": [
    {
        "@type": "Relationship",
        "name": "satellites",
        "target": "dtmi:com:contoso:Moon;1"
    },
    {
        "@type": "Component",
        "name": "deepestCrater",
        "schema": "dtmi:com:contoso:Crater;1"
    }
    ]
},
{
    "@id": "dtmi:com:contoso:Crater;1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "@context": "dtmi:dtdl:context;2"
}
]
====

In this example, CelestialBody contributes a name, a mass, and a temperature to Planet.

The extends section is an interface name, or an array of interface names (allowing the extending interface to inherit from multiple parent models if desired).

Once inheritance is applied, the extending interface exposes all properties from the entire inheritance chain.

The extending interface cannot change any of the definitions of the parent interfaces; it can only add to them.

It also cannot redefine a capability already defined in any of its parent interfaces

For example, if a parent interface defines a double property mass, the extending interface cannot contain a declaration of mass, even if it's also a double.

[discrete]
===  digital twins and graph construction
In an Azure Digital Twins solution, the entities in your environment are represented by digital twins.

Each digital twin is an instance of one of your custom-defined digital models.

A digital twin can be connected to other digital twins via relationships to form a twin graph (a representation of your entire environment).

image::https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/examine-components-azure-digital-twins-solution/media/m11-l02-adt-graph-models-6a4c9f9b.png[]

The image below shows a simplified Contoso Cheese Factory Azure Digital Twins environment expressed as a twin graph.

The graph contains seven digital twin nodes connected by relationships. To the left of the twins graph are the corresponding models.

[discrete]
==== Digital twins
Since the digital twins nodes that you create in your Azure Digital Twins solution are based on a model type, the first step in adding a digital twin to Azure Digital Twins is to upload a model type to your Azure Digital Twins service.

After creating and uploading a model, you can create an instance of the type; the digital twin.

For example, after creating a model of type Cheese Cave, you can create one or more digital twins that use this type (for example, a Cheese Cave digital twin called Cave_1, another called Cave_2, etc.).

[discrete]
==== Relationships: a graph of digital twins
Twins are connected into a twin graph by their relationships.

The relationships that a twin can have are defined as part of its model.

Twins are connected into a twin graph by their relationships.

The relationships that a twin can have are defined as part of its model.

For example, the model Cheese Factory might define a “Has Caves” relationship that targets twins of type Cheese Cave.

With this definition, Azure Digital Twins will allow you to create “Has Caves” relationships from any Cheese Factory twin to any Cheese Cave twin.

The result of this process is a set of nodes (the digital twins) connected via edges (their relationships) in a graph.

[discrete]
==== Visualization
While the primary way to interact with your Azure Digital Twins instance is through the APIs and SDKs, it can be helpful to see a visualization of the twins and graphs that you are creating in your instance.

Microsoft provides a sample application, the Azure Digital Twins explorer, that can be used to visualize the Azure Digital Twins graph and to edit the twins and models.
