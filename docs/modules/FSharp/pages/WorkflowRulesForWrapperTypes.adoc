* Rule 1: If you start with an unwrapped value, and then you wrap it (using return ),then unwrap it (using bind ), you should always get back the original unwrapped value.
* Rule 2: If you start with a wrapped value, and then you unwrap it (using bind ), then wrap it (using return ), you should always get back the original wrapped value.
* Rule 3: If you create a child workflow, it must produce the same result as if you had "inlined" the logic in the main workflow.
