One of the major uses of computation expressions is to implicitly unwrap and rewrap values that are stored in some sort of wrapper type.

Say we are accessing a database, and we want to capture the result in a Success/Error union type:

[source,fsharp]
----
type DbResult<'a> =
    | Success of 'a
    | Error of string
----

We then use this type in our database access methods.

[source,fsharp]
----
let getCustomerId name =
    if name = ""
    then Error "getCustomerId failed"
    else Success "Cust42"

let getLastOrderForCustomer custId =
    if custId = ""
    then Error "getLastOrderForCustomer failed"
    else Success "Order123"

let getLastProductForOrder orderId =
    if orderId = ""
    then Error "getLastProductForOrder failed"
    else Success "Product456"
----

Now lets say we want to chain these calls together.

Here is the most explicit way of doing it. +
As you can see, we have to have pattern matching at each step.

[source,fsharp]
----
let product =
    let r1 = getCustomerId "Alice"
    match r1 with
    | Error _ -> r1
    | Success custId ->
        let r2 = getLastOrderForCustomer custId
        match r2 with
        | Error _ -> r2
        | Success orderId ->
            let r3 = getLastProductForOrder orderId
            match r3 with
            | Error _ -> r3
            | Success productId ->
                printfn "Product is %s" productId
                r3
----

Really ugly code. And the top-level flow has been submerged in the error handling logic.

Computation expressions to the rescue! We can write one that handles the branching of Success/Error behind the scenes:

[source,fsharp]
----
type DbResultBuilder() =

    member this.Bind(x,f) =
        match x with
        | Error _ -> x
        | Success y ->
            printfn "\tSuccessful: %s" y
            f y

    member this.Return(x) =
        Success x

let dbResult = new DbResultBuilder();
----

And with this workflow, we can focus on the big picture and write much cleaner code:

[source,fsharp]
----
let product' =
    dbResult {
        let! custId = getCustomerId "Alice"
        let! orderId = getLastOrderForCustomer custId
        let! productId = getLastProductForOrder orderId
        printfn "Product is %s" productId
        return productId
    }

printfn "%A" product
----

And if there are errors, the workflow traps them nicely and tells us where the error was:

[source,fsharp]
----
let product'' =
    dbResult {
        let! custId = getCustomerId "Alice"
        let! orderId = getLastOrderForCustomer "" //error
        let! productId = getLastProductForOrder orderId
        printfn "Product is %s" productId
        return productId
    }

printfn "%A" product
----

Every computation expression must have an associated wrapper type. +
And the wrapper type is often designed to go hand-in-hand with the workflow that we want to manage.
