What value should you use for Zero?

- Does the workflow have a concept of “success” or “failure”? If so, use the “failure” value for Zero. 
- Does the workflow have a concept of “sequential processing”? That is, in your workflow you do one step and then another, with some processing behind the scenes. In normal F# code, an expression that did not return anything explicitly would evaluate to unit. So to parallel this case, your Zero should be the wrapped version of unit. 
- Is the workflow primarily concerned with manipulating data structures? If so, Zero should be the “empty” data structure.

            | Some a ->

            Some x

        member this.ReturnFrom(x) =
            printfn "Returning an option (%A) directly" x
            x

        member this.Zero() =
            printfn "Zero"
            None

    // make an instance of the workflow
    let trace = new TraceBuilder()

    //test
    trace {
        printfn "hello world"
    } |> printfn "Result for simple expression: %A"

    trace {
        if false then return 1
    } |> printfn "Result for if without else: %A"

The test code makes it clear that Zero is being called behind the scenes. 
And None is the return value for the expression as whole.

You not required to have a Zero, but only if it makes sense in the context of the workflow. 
For example seq does not allow zero, but async does:

[source,fsharp]
----
//let s = seq {printfn "zero" }    // Error
let a = async {printfn "zero" }  // OK
