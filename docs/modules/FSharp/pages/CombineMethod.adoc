The Combine method only has two parameters. So what happens when you combine more than two values? +
A subtle but important point is that they are combined “backwards”, starting from the last value.

== Implementing Combine for workflows with "success" or "failure"

If the workflow has some concept of "success" or "failure", then a standard approach is: +
- If the first expression "succeeds" then use that value. +
- Otherwise use the value of the second expression. +

This approach is useful for chaining together a series of "or else" expressions where the first success "wins" and becomes the overall result.

== Implementing Combine for worflows with sequential steps

If the workflow has the concept of sequential steps, then the overall result is just the value of the last step, and all the previous steps are evaluated only for their side effects.

In normal F#, this would be written: +
do some expression +
do some other expression +
final expression

In normal F#, each expression (other than the last) evaluates to the unit value.

The equivalent approach for computation expression is to treat each expression (other than the last) as a wrapped unit value, and "pass it into" the next expression, and so on, until you reach the last expression.

== Implementing combine for workflows that build data structures

In this case, Combine should merge the two data structures in whatever way is appropriate. +
And the Zero method should create an empty data structure, if needed.

== Guidelines for mixing "Combine" and "Zero"

We have looked at different implementations for Combine for option types. +
- The first one used options as "success/failure" indicators, when the first success "won". +
  In this case Zero was defined as None +
- The second one was sequential. In this case Zero was defined as Some ()

There is a useful rule that connects Zero and Combine +
Rule:- Combine(a,Zero) should be the same as Combine(Zero,a) which should be the same as just a
