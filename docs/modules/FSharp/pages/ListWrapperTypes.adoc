== List Workflow

The bind function “unwraps” the type, and applies the continuation function to the unwrapped value. +

The continuation function passed into bind is required to have a certain signature. +
It takes an unwrapped type, but it produces a wrapped type.

In other words, the continuation function must always create a new list as its result.

We can now create a “list workflow”.

Bind applies the continuation function to each element of the passed in list, and then flattens the resulting list of lists into a one-level list. List.collect is a library function that does exactly that. +
Return converts from unwrapped to wrapped. In this case, that just means wrapping a single element in a list.

module Sample1 =
    type ListWorkflowBuilder() =

        member this.Bind(list,f) =
            list |> List.collect f

        member this.Return(x) =
            [x]

    let listWorkflow = new ListWorkflowBuilder()

    let added =
        listWorkflow {
            let! i = [1;2;3]
            let! j = [10;11;12]
            return i + j
        }

    printfn "added=%A" added
----

What F# does behind the scenes is:

[source,fsharp]
----
    let addedM = listWorkflow.Bind([1;2;3], fun x ->
                                listWorkflow.Bind([10;11;12], fun y ->
                                    listWorkflow.Return (x + y)))

    printfn "added=%A" addedM
----

== Syntactic sugar for "for"

[source,fsharp]
----
// let version
let! i = [1;2;3] in [some expression]

// for..in..do version
for i in [1;2;3] do [some expression]
----


We need to add a For method to our builder class. +
It generally has exactly the same implementation as the normal Bind method, but is required to accept the sequence type.

module Sample2 =
    type ListWorkflowBuilder() =

        member this.Bind(lst,f) =
            lst |> List.collect f

        member this.Return(x) =
            [x]

        member this.For(lst, f) =
            this.Bind(lst, f)

    let listWorkflow = new ListWorkflowBuilder()

    let multiplied =
        listWorkflow {
            for i in [1;2;3] do
            for j in [10;11;12] do
                return i * j
        }

    printfn "multiplied: %A" multiplied

    //For is the same as bind but it needs to accept the sequence type.
