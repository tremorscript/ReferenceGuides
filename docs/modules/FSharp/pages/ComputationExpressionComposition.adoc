One of the major uses of computation expressions is to implicitly unwrap and rewrap values that are stored in some sort of wrapper type.

Every computation expression must have an associated wrapper type. +
This wrapper type is used in both Bind and Return, which leads to a key benefit: +
the output of a Return can be fed to the input of a Bind

In other words, because a workflow returns a wrapper type, and because let! consumes a wrapper type, you can put a “child” workflow on the right hand side of a let! expression.

let subworkflow0 = myworkflow { return 42 }
let subworkflow1 = myworkflow { return 43 }

let aWrappedValue =
    myworkflow {
        let! unwrappedValue1 = subworkflow1
        let! unwrappedValue2 = subworkflow2
        return unwrappedValue1 + unwrappedValue2
        }

let aWrappedValue =
myworkflow {
    let! unwrappedValue1 = myworkflow {
        let! x = myworkflow { return 1 }
        return x
        }
    let! unwrappedValue2 = myworkflow {
        let! y = myworkflow { return 2 }
        return y
        }
    return unwrappedValue1 + unwrappedValue2
    }

Sometimes we have a function that already returns a wrapped value, and we want to return it directly.
return is no good for this, because it requires an unwrapped type as input.

The solution is a variant on return called return!, which takes a wrapped type as input and returns it.

The corresponding method in the “builder” class is called ReturnFrom.
Typically the implementation just returns the wrapped type “as is”
