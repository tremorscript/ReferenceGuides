The MSDN documentation says that it has the signature 'T -> M<'T>, which is exactly the same as the signature for the Return method. 
It must take an unwrapped value and wrap it.

If *return* and *yield* are basically the same thing, why are there two different keywords? +
The answer is mainly so that you can enforce appropriate syntax by implementing one but not the other. +
For example, the *seq* expression does allow yield but doesnâ€™t allow return, while the *async* does allow return, but does not allow yield.
