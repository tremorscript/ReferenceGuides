The MSDN documentation says that it has the signature 'T -> M<'T>, which is exactly the same as the signature for the Return method. 
It must take an unwrapped value and wrap it.

If return and yield are basically the same thing, why are there two different keywords? +
The answer is mainly so that you can enforce appropriate syntax by implementing one but not the other. +
For example, the seq expression does allow yield but doesn’t allow return, while the async does allow return, but does not allow yield.
