Let's say we have some code, and we want to log each step.

[source,fsharp]
----
let loggedWorkflow =
    let x = 42
    log x
    let y = 43
    log y
    let z = x + y
    log z
    //return
    z
----

But it is annoying to have to explicitly write all the log statements each time.
Is there a way to hide them?
A computation expression can do that.

[source,fsharp]
----
type LoggingBuilder() =
    let log p = printfn "expression is %A" p

    member this.Bind(x, f) =
        log x
        f x

    member this.Return(x) =
        x
----

Next we create an instance of the type, logger in this case.

[source,fsharp]
----
let logger = new LoggingBuilder()
----

So with this logger value, we can rewrite the original logging example like this:

[souce,fsharp]
----
let loggedWorkflow1 =
    logger {
        let! x = 42
        let! y = 43
        let! z = x + y
        return z
    }
----

F# internally converts this to the following:

[source,fsharp]
----
let value = logger.Bind(42, fun x ->
                                logger.Bind(43, fun y ->
                                    logger.Bind(x + y, fun z -> z)
                                    ))
