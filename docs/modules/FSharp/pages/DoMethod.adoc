Operations with and without *'!'*

Operations without a *“!”* always have unwrapped types on the right hand side, +
while the ones with a *“!”* always have wrapped types.

In normal F#, *do* is just like *let*, except that the expression returns a unit value. +
Inside a computation expression, *do!* is very similar. +
Just as *let!* passes a wrapped result to the Bind method, so does *do!*, except that in the case of *do!* the “result” is the unit value, and so a wrapped version of unit is passed to the bind method.
