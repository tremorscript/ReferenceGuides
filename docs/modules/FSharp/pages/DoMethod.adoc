Operations with and without '!'

Operations without a “!” always have unwrapped types on the right hand side, +
while the ones with a “!” always have wrapped types.

In normal F#, do is just like let, except that the expression returns a unit value). +
Inside a computation expression, do! is very similar. +
Just as let! passes a wrapped result to the Bind method, so does do!, except that in the case of do! the “result” is the unit value, and so a wrapped version of unit is passed to the bind method.
