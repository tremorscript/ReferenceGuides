This is my personal short notes from https://think-like-a-git.net/ and various other sources. +
If I learn something new in git, I intend to put it here. +

== Basics

A git repository is one giant graph.

At the surface level, a git commit consists of 2 things:-

* a pointer to the state of your code at some moment in time.
* zero or more pointers to "parent" commits

*A Git commit is a node in a graph*, and each one points to the node that came before them.

== git log 

To list all commits in your repository: +
`git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all`

To list all commits in your repository but with a graph view: +
`git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph`

If you want to see branch and tag labels, add `--decorate`: +
`git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color`

You can setup a git alias to do the same thing:
`git config --global alias.graph "log --graph --oneline –decorate=short"`


== References

GitX shows the logs as follows:-

The very colourful labels are called *references*.

*References are pointers to commits.*

There are three types of references: *local branch*, *remote branch*, and *tag*.

A *local branch reference* is a file that contains a 40-byte identifier of the commit that the reference points to. +
This file is created at the project's `.git/refs/head` directory. +
Creating a branch in Git just means writing 40 bytes to disk, which is why `git branch foo`` is so fast.

*Local branch references* are specific to a single local repository. +
Commands that affect local branch references include *commit*, *merge*, *rebase*, and *reset*.

*Remote branch references* are also specific to a single repository, but one that's previously been defined as a remote. +
Commands that affect remote branch references include *fetch* and *push*. 

*Tag references* are branch references that never move. +
*Once you've created a tag, it will never change* +
This behavior makes them useful for marking specific versions of a software package, or marking exactly what got deployed to a production server on a particular date. +
Only one command affects the tag and i.e *git tag*

Now look at the display:-

However, you don't see commits here. Every git tool hides commits.

== Garbage collection
Imagine this scenario: you write some code and check it in. Then, you realize you forgot to run the tests, so you run them, and they uncover a syntax error. 
Or you spot a typo. For whatever reason, you weren't done when you thought you were done. 

Git gives you an option to tack the new change on to the previous commit using: +
`git commit --amend`. +
This keeps all your related changes bundled together in one commit.

A git commit is a SHA-1 hash of the contents of the commit, and the IDs of its parent commits.

Which means that, when you use `git commit --amend`, you're actually building a completely different commit, and pointing your local branch reference to it instead. +
*The first commit you made is still there on disk, and you can still get back to it*

Git will decide that it's time to run garbage collection. +
You can trigger this process yourself, using `git gc`.

*Starting from every branch and every tag, Git walks back through the graph, building a list of every commit it can reach. Once it's reached the end of every path, it deletes all the commits it didn't visit.*

The Secret Of Git can fit it into these four words:
*References make commits reachable.*

== References make commits reachable

*References* `...` whether they are local branches, remote branches, or tags `...`

*Make commits* `...` which are nodes in a graph `...`

*Reachable* `...` so that you can get back to them, and so that Git will not delete them when it decides it is time for spring cleaning.

== Branches as savepoints

Because *references make commits reachable*, creating a branch is a way to "nail down" part of the graph that you might want to come back to later.

Neither `git merge` nor `git rebase` will change your existing commits (remember, a commit's ID is a hash of its contents _*and its history*_), you can create a temporary branch any time you want to try something you're even just a little bit unsure about.

*Creating a branch before you try a merge or a rebase is like saving your game before you battle the boss.*

== git merge

=== the scout pattern

Use this pattern if you are unsure or unclear on exactly what `git merge` does.

== git rebase

Before you start using rebase in a shared repository, make sure everyone who works on your project is comfortable working with rebase. You might also consider changing everyone's default pull strategy to "rebase" instead of "merge"

=== git cherry-pick
What `git cherry-pick` does is take a commit from somewhere else, and "play it back" wherever you are right now. + 
Because this introduces the same change with a different parent, Git builds a new commit with a different ID.

.Example

.Source: think-like-a-git.net
image::https://think-like-a-git.net/assets/images2/reachability-example.png[]

If you were at node H in this graph, and you typed `git cherry-pick E`, you get a copy of commit E, let's call it E', that pointed to H as its parent.

.Source: think-like-a-git.net
image::https://think-like-a-git.net/assets/images2/cherry-pick-example-1.png[]

Or if you typed something like `git cherry-pick C D E`, you get the following:

.Source: think-like-a-git.net
image::https://think-like-a-git.net/assets/images2/cherry-pick-example-2.png[]

The important thing to notice here is that Git has copied changes made in one place, and replayed them somewhere else.

=== Using 'git cherry-pick' to Simulate 'git rebase' 

Again being lazy and since it is very well explained here. +
https://think-like-a-git.net/sections/rebase-from-the-ground-up/using-git-cherry-pick-to-simulate-git-rebase.html

=== A Helpful Mnemonic for 'git rebase' Arguments

To summarize the previous section, this:

----
git checkout foo
git checkout -b newbar
git cherry-pick C D E
git checkout bar
git reset --hard newbar
git branch -d newbar 
----

is equivalent to this:

----
git rebase foo bar 
----

When you do a rebase, you are rewriting history. You are, in effect, saying to Git, "Hey, you know those things that happened over there on that completely different timeline? I want you to pretend that they happened here instead."

Here's how I think of it: in English, we read from left to right. On most charts that show the change in something over time, time is shown on the x-axis of the graph, with time increasing from left to right. When you issue commands to the shell, you can put several of them on one line, and they'll be executed in order from left to right.

So when I use git rebase, I (almost) always give it two arguments: the name of the place I want to start from, and the name of the place I want to end up. Or, to put it another way, I tell rebase the sequence of events I want it to create, from left to right: git rebase first_this then_this


== How to change git remote origin

There may be a time when you would like to change the origin url of your git repository to point to another url.

You can use the following sequence of commands to do that:

[source,console]
----
git remote rename origin upstream # <1>
git remote add origin https://github.com/<GitHub_username>/simple-feed-reader/ # <2>
git push -u origin main # <3>
----
<1> Rename the existing origin remote to upstream
<2> Add a new origin remote pointing to your copy of the repository on GitHub.
<3> Publish your local Git repository to the newly created GitHub repository.


== Commit Best Practices

.commit guidelines
* Make small commits and commit often.
* Commit complete and well tested code.
* Don't mix whitespace changes with functional code changes.
* Write good commit messages.

.commit message guidelines
* Why is it necessary? (Fix a bug, increase performance, add a feature)
* How does it address the issue? For short and obvious changes, this can be omitted.
* What effects does this change have? (may include benchmarks, side effects etc)
* What limitations does the current code have? (not necessary, but helps if you can think about it)

.commit message considerations
* Don't assume that the code is self-evident/self-documenting.
* Finding it difficult to summarize your commit? Maybe it includes more than one bug fix or logical change. Consider splitting the commits using `git add -p`
* It should be possible to review a change request without reading the contents of the bug or task. Don't assume the reviwer understands the problem.

.commit message structure
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line (Fix typo in log vs. Fixed typo in log or Misc fixes in log code)
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
* Reference fixed issues with https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords[closing keywords,window=_blank]

.commit message sample
====

====

You can specify which editor you would like to use for commit messages.
[source, console]
----
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
----

== Versioning

=== Version numbers
`major.minor[.build[.revision]]`

Upon CI build these version numbers are generated.
During CD release components are pushed to a component repository such as Nuget, npm, docker hub where a history of different versions is being kept.

Each build the version number is incremented at the last digit.

Updating the major / minor version indicates changes of the API / interfaces / contracts:

* Major Version: A breaking change
* Minor Version: A backwards-compatible minor change
* Build / Revision: No API change, just a different build.s

=== Semantic Versioning
Semantic Versioning is a concept of calculating the version number automatically based on a certain source code repository.

The semver tool looks at a GIT source control branch and comes up with a repeatable and unique version number based on

* number of commits since last major or minor release
* commit messages
* tags
* branch names

Run semvar during the CI process to make each build uniquely identifiable.
